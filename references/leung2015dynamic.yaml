description: "The manuscript presents a pair-formation model for a dynamic homosexual\
  \ network to study the spread of an SI (Susceptible-Infectious) infection. Individuals\
  \ enter the population at a constant rate and leave after an exponentially distributed\
  \ time (rate \tochy). Each individual possesses 'n' independent 'binding sites'\
  \ that can be either free or occupied by a partner. Partnership formation occurs\
  \ when a free site of an individual forms a bond with a free site from the general\
  \ pool of free sites (represented by F, the fraction of free sites in the population).\
  \ The per-free-site partnership formation rate is \text{ρF}. Partnerships dissolve\
  \ due to separation (rate \text{σ}) or death of a partner (rate \tochy). The state\
  \ of an uninfected individual is defined by 'k', the number of occupied binding\
  \ sites (0 ≤ k ≤ n). Newborn individuals have k=0 (all sites free).\n\nWhen SI infection\
  \ is superimposed, an individual's state is (x, k-, k+), where x is disease status\
  \ (Susceptible '-' or Infectious '+'), k- is the number of susceptible partners,\
  \ and k+ is the number of infectious partners. Infection status does not alter partnership\
  \ dynamics or individual death rates. Transmission occurs within an S-I partnership\
  \ at a rate \text{β}. A 'mean field at distance one' approximation is employed:\
  \ if a susceptible partner 'v' of a focal individual 'u' becomes infected by one\
  \ of 'v's *other* partners, the rate at which this event affects 'u's state (i.e.,\
  \ changing counts of k- and k+) depends on population-average infection characteristics\
  \ of these second-order partners. These are captured by terms \text{Λ-} (if 'u'\
  \ is susceptible) and \text{Λ+} (if 'u' is infectious). The model is formulated\
  \ as a system of (n+1)(n+2) ordinary differential equations (ODEs) for the population\
  \ fractions in each state. The basic reproduction number, R0, is characterized using\
  \ a next-generation matrix (NGM) approach, analyzed at both the binding site and\
  \ individual levels."
