description: 'The manuscript describes a pair-formation transmission model used to
  simulate chlamydia transmission in a heterosexual population in the United States.
  The model is stratified by sex, age group (15–18, 19–24, 25–39, and 40–54 years),
  and partnership status (not sexually active, sexually active people not in a long-term
  partnership, and sexually active people in long-term partnerships). Long-term partnerships
  are parameterized to reflect cohabiting partnerships. The model characterizes the
  population in terms of discrete health states: chlamydia-susceptible or chlamydia-infected.
  Infected states are further stratified by symptomatic/asymptomatic categories and
  first/subsequent infections. Recovery occurs via natural processes or diagnosis
  and treatment. Sexual partnerships are characterized by the combination of health
  states of the two partners. Partner notification (PN) is modeled within long-term
  partnerships. The model was previously calibrated to multiple epidemiological datasets
  for the years 2000 to 2015 (detailed in their reference 2). Specific quantitative
  parameters detailing the rates of pair formation, dissolution, or sexual act frequency
  per partnership type are not explicitly listed in this manuscript but are part of
  the underlying referenced model; this manuscript focuses on application and outcomes.'
infection_model: Chlamydia trachomatis. The model includes states for susceptible
  and infected individuals. Infected individuals can be symptomatic or asymptomatic,
  and the model distinguishes between first and subsequent infections. Sequelae of
  infection modeled include pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), chronic pelvic pain
  (CPP), tubal factor infertility (TFI), and ectopic pregnancy (EP) in women, and
  epididymitis in men.
