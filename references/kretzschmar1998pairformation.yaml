description: "The manuscript presents and compares two main types of pair-formation\
  \ models for sexually transmitted infections without recovery: one with constant\
  \ infectivity (Model M(+/c)) and one with variable infectivity over two stages (Model\
  \ M(+/v)). Both are contrasted with simpler models assuming instantaneous contacts\
  \ (M(0/c) and M(0/v)).\n\nModel M(+/c) - Pair Formation with Constant Infectivity:\n\
  This model tracks the number of uninfected singles (X0), infected singles (X1),\
  \ pairs of two susceptibles (P00), pairs with one susceptible and one infected (P01),\
  \ and pairs with two infecteds (P11). The total number of singles is X = X0 + X1.\n\
  The dynamics are described by a system of ordinary differential equations (Eq. 3,\
  \ page 86):\n- Recruitment: New susceptible individuals enter X0 at rate ν.\n- Departure:\
  \ Individuals leave any state (singles or from pairs) at a per-capita rate μ.\n\
  - Pair Formation: Singles form pairs based on random mixing, with ρ being the per-capita\
  \ rate for a single to seek a partner.\n  - X0 + X0 -> P00: rate (1/2)ρ(X0^2)/X\n\
  \  - X0 + X1 (no transmission at formation): -> P01 at rate ρ(1-h)X0X1/X\n  - X0\
  \ + X1 (transmission at formation): -> P11 at rate ρhX0X1/X\n  - X1 + X1 -> P11:\
  \ rate (1/2)ρ(X1^2)/X\n- Pair Dissolution: Pairs (P00, P01, P11) dissolve at a rate\
  \ σ (separation). Combined with departure μ for each partner, the total rate of\
  \ a pair ending is (σ+2μ).\n  - P00 dissolves to 2X0.\n  - P01 dissolves to X0 +\
  \ X1.\n  - P11 dissolves to 2X1.\n- Infection within Pairs: In a P01 pair (Susceptible-Infected),\
  \ the susceptible partner can become infected at a rate φh (where φ is the contact\
  \ frequency within a partnership and h is the transmission probability per contact).\
  \ This converts a P01 pair into a P11 pair.\n  - dP01/dt includes a term -φhP01.\n\
  \  - dP11/dt includes a term +φhP01.\nThe full system of ODEs is provided in Eq.\
  \ (3) on page 86.\n\nModel M(+/v) - Pair Formation with Variable Infectivity:\n\
  This model extends M(+/c) by incorporating two stages of infection for infected\
  \ individuals: stage 1 (e.g., acute, infectivity h1) and stage 2 (e.g., chronic,\
  \ infectivity h2). Infected individuals progress from stage 1 to stage 2 at a rate\
  \ γ.\nThe state variables expand to include X0 (uninfected singles), X1 (infected\
  \ singles, stage 1), X2 (infected singles, stage 2), and various pair types: P00\
  \ (S-S), P01 (S-I1), P02 (S-I2), P11 (I1-I1), P12 (I1-I2), P22 (I2-I2). The total\
  \ number of singles is X = X0+X1+X2.\nPair formation and dissolution dynamics are\
  \ analogous to M(+/c), but account for the different infection stages and their\
  \ respective transmission probabilities (h1, h2) at formation and during the partnership\
  \ (φh1, φh2).\nProgression through infection stages (rate γ) also changes the state\
  \ of singles (X1 -> X2) and the type of pairs (e.g., a P01 pair becomes P02 if the\
  \ I1 partner progresses; an I1 in a P11 pair progresses, changing it to P12).\n\
  The full derivation and system of ODEs for the 9 state variables are detailed in\
  \ Appendix A (page 108). A reduced 6-equation model (system 22, page 98) is also\
  \ presented in terms of X1, X2, P01, P02, and total infected in stage 1 (I1) and\
  \ stage 2 (I2).\n\nBoth models assume a constant total population size N = ν/μ at\
  \ equilibrium. They explore epidemic characteristics like the initial phase, exponential\
  \ growth rate (r), and endemic equilibrium, comparing them to models without explicit\
  \ pair duration under the assumption of equal Basic Reproduction Ratios (R0)."
infection_model: "SI-type (Susceptible-Infected) without recovery. Two main variants\
  \ are detailed for pair-formation models: \n1. Constant infectivity (Model M(+/c)):\
  \ Infected individuals have a constant transmission probability 'h' per contact\
  \ throughout their infectious period.\n2. Two-stage variable infectivity (Model\
  \ M(+/v)): Infected individuals pass through two stages. Stage 1 has transmission\
  \ probability 'h1' per contact, and stage 2 has 'h2'. Progression from stage 1 to\
  \ stage 2 occurs at rate 'γ'."
