description: "The manuscript develops three nested deterministic Ordinary Differential\
  \ Equation (ODE) based pair-formation models to study the impact of concurrency\
  \ on Sexually Transmitted Infection (STI) spread and control by vaccination. The\
  \ STI dynamics follow a Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) pattern. \nModel\
  \ 1 (No Concurrency): Individuals are either Susceptible (S) or Infected (I) and\
  \ can be single or in stable partnerships ([SS], [SI], [II]). Single individuals\
  \ form stable partnerships at a rate 'f' per individual, with partners chosen randomly\
  \ from the single population. Stable partnerships break up at a rate '2b' (where\
  \ 'b' is the per-partner breakup rate). Transmission within an [SI] partnership\
  \ occurs at rate 'τ', converting the S partner to I. Infected individuals recover\
  \ at rate 'γ'. The total population is normalized, S + I + 2([SS] + [SI] + [II])\
  \ = 1. Equations 1.1-1.5 describe this model.\nModel 2 (Casual Partnerships for\
  \ Singles): This model extends Model 1. Single susceptible individuals can acquire\
  \ infection through casual partnerships with single infected individuals. Single\
  \ individuals (S or I) form casual partnerships at a rate 'κ'. Transmission occurs\
  \ with probability 'p' per casual partnership. This adds terms to the dS/dt and\
  \ dI/dt equations (Eq. 2.1-2.2).\nModel 3 (Concurrency): This model extends Model\
  \ 2 by allowing individuals already in stable partnerships to also engage in casual\
  \ partnerships (concurrent partnerships). Partnered individuals engage in casual\
  \ partnerships at a rate 'K'. These casual encounters can be with single individuals\
  \ or other partnered individuals. The infection prevalence among those available\
  \ for casual sex is denoted Î = (κI + K(P_I)) / (κF + KP_total), where F is total\
  \ singles, P_I is infected partnered individuals, and P_total is total partnered\
  \ individuals. Susceptible individuals in stable pairs ([SS] or [SI]) can thus acquire\
  \ infection through these external casual partnerships. Two variations are considered:\
  \ Model 3.1 (K=κ) and Model 3.2 (κ=2K, singles have twice the casual rate of partnered\
  \ individuals). Equations 3.1-3.6 describe this model.\nAll models assume homogeneous\
  \ mixing within the population, ignoring gender, age structure, or sexual preference\
  \ in the core model structure, though parameters are informed by age/sex-specific\
  \ data. The population is initially assumed to be closed (no births/deaths). Vaccination\
  \ is later introduced to Model 3 to assess control efficacy."
