description: 'The manuscript describes a deterministic compartment model for pair
  formation and separation in a closed, homosexual population, which can be extended
  to heterosexual populations. The model distinguishes two types of partnerships:
  ''steady'' (P) and ''casual'' (Q), based on their average duration. A fraction ''f''
  of newly formed pairs are steady, and the remaining (1-f) are casual. Individuals
  are categorized as uninfected singles (X0), infected singles (X1), and pairs. Pairs
  can be of three types based on the infection status of partners: susceptible-susceptible
  (P00, Q00), susceptible-infected (P01, Q01), and infected-infected (P11, Q11).


  Pair formation occurs between single individuals. The rate of pair formation between
  individuals of type i and type j is given by the function φ(Xi, Xj) = ρ * Xi * Xj
  / (X0 + X1), where ρ is the overall rate of pair formation for singles, and X0 and
  X1 are the total numbers of uninfected and infected singles, respectively (Equation
  2, page 187). For example, the rate of formation of X0-X0 pairs is ρ * X0^2 / (X0
  + X1), and X0-X1 pairs is ρ * X0*X1 / (X0 + X1).


  The dynamics of the system are described by a set of ordinary differential equations
  (Equations 3-10, pages 187-188):

  - dX0/dt = κ - μX0 - ρX0 + σ1(2P00 + P01) + σ2(2Q00 + Q01) + μ(2P00 + P01 + 2Q00
  + Q01) + γX1

  - dX1/dt = -μX1 - ρX1 + σ1(2P11 + P01) + σ2(2Q11 + Q01) + μ(2P11 + P01 + 2Q11 +
  Q01) - γX1

  - dP00/dt = (1/2) * f * ρ * X0^2/(X0+X1) - σ1*P00 - 2μ*P00 + γ*P01

  - dP01/dt = f * ρ * X0*X1/(X0+X1) - σ1*P01 - 2μ*P01 - λ1*P01 - γ*P01 + 2γ*P11

  - dP11/dt = (1/2) * f * ρ * X1^2/(X0+X1) - σ1*P11 - 2μ*P11 + λ1*P01 - 2γ*P11

  - dQ00/dt = (1/2) * (1-f) * ρ * X0^2/(X0+X1) - σ2*Q00 - 2μ*Q00 + γ*Q01

  - dQ01/dt = (1-f) * ρ * X0*X1/(X0+X1) - σ2*Q01 - 2μ*Q01 - λ2*Q01 - γ*Q01 + 2γ*Q11

  - dQ11/dt = (1/2) * (1-f) * ρ * X1^2/(X0+X1) - σ2*Q11 - 2μ*Q11 + λ2*Q01 - 2γ*Q11


  Here, κ is recruitment rate, μ is departure rate from sexual activity, σ1 and σ2
  are separation rates for steady and casual pairs, λ1 and λ2 are transmission rates
  in steady and casual S-I pairs, and γ is the recovery rate. The term ρX0 in dX0/dt
  implies that all X0 individuals form pairs at rate ρ (the specific pairing depends
  on partners available). The factor of 1/2 for X0^2 and X1^2 terms in P00, P11, Q00,
  Q11 equations accounts for each pair involving two individuals. The model assumes
  that the pair formation process is at equilibrium when studying disease dynamics.'
infection_model: The manuscript describes a Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS)
  type infection model. Transmission of the sexually transmitted disease can occur
  within discordant pairs (S-I), i.e., P01 and Q01. The transmission rate in steady
  S-I pairs is λ1, and in casual S-I pairs is λ2. Upon infection, a susceptible individual
  in an S-I pair transitions the pair to an I-I type (e.g., P01 becomes P11). Infected
  individuals recover at a rate γ, returning to the susceptible state. If an infected
  partner in an S-I pair recovers, the pair becomes S-S (e.g., P01 becomes P00). If
  one partner in an I-I pair recovers, the pair becomes S-I (e.g., P11 becomes P01).
  There is no disease-induced mortality. The model allows for continuous reinfection
  of partners within a partnership if one recovers and the other is still infectious,
  followed by re-transmission.

population_structure: The model assumes a homosexual population. The population is
  structured by infection status (susceptible, infected) and partnership status (single,
  in a steady pair, in a casual pair). It is also implicitly structured by the type
  of pair (steady or casual) individuals are in. The population is otherwise considered
  homogeneous with respect to the propensity to form partnerships (governed by a single
  rate ρ for all singles).
