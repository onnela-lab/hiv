description: "The manuscript does not define a new, self-contained pair-formation\
  \ model with explicit simulation algorithms. Instead, it meticulously describes\
  \ a methodology to estimate age- and gender-specific heterosexual partnership formation\
  \ and dissolution rates, and partnership durations, using data from a population-based\
  \ survey (2003-2004 Seattle RDD survey, N=1,194, ages 18-39). These estimates are\
  \ intended as parameters for mathematical models of STI transmission.\nThe core\
  \ estimation approach is the \"observed-plus-imputed\" method. This method combines:\n\
  1.  Egocentric partnership data: Start and end dates for up to five most recent\
  \ partners.\n2.  Imputation for missing data:\n    *   Missing days/months in reported\
  \ partnerships were imputed (e.g., random day assignment, assumed average durations\
  \ like 7 or 67 days based on context).\n    *   Partnerships beyond the five enumerated\
  \ (for individuals reporting >5 lifetime partners) were imputed. If one partner\
  \ was \"missing\" from enumeration but accounted for in lifetime total, it was assumed\
  \ to begin at sexual debut. For multiple \"missing\" partners, their start dates\
  \ were equally distributed between age at sexual debut and the start of the earliest\
  \ enumerated partnership.\n    *   Durations for these imputed, unenumerated partnerships\
  \ were randomly sampled with replacement from the durations of fully described partnerships,\
  \ matched by gender, age (Â±1 year), and constrained by the maximum possible duration\
  \ for that imputed partnership.\nPartnership Formation Rates: Calculated per age\
  \ group by dividing the total number of partnerships (observed + imputed) begun\
  \ at each age by the total person-time observed at that age. Person-time accrued\
  \ from age 16.\nPartnership Dissolution: Analyzed using Kaplan-Meier techniques\
  \ on observed and imputed partnership durations to calculate dissolution probabilities\
  \ over time.\nThe paper also presents \"observed-only\" analyses (limited to explicitly\
  \ reported recent partnerships) for comparison, highlighting that these tend to\
  \ underestimate formation rates and overestimate durations due to sampling biases.\
  \ The \"observed-plus-imputed\" method is presented as a way to mitigate these biases."
