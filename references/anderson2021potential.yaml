description: "The study employs a dynamic stochastic network model to simulate sexual\
  \ partnerships among Men who have Sex with Men (MSM) in San Francisco and Atlanta,\
  \ with the primary goal of estimating the Forward-Reachable Path (FRP). The pair-formation\
  \ model is based on Exponential Random Graph Models (ERGMs) and Temporal ERGMs (TERGMs).\n\
  1.  **Data and Targets**: Empirical network statistics derived from the ARTnet survey\
  \ (egocentrically sampled data) serve as inputs. These include individual-level\
  \ measures like momentary degree, past-year cumulative partner counts, partnership\
  \ durations, and assortative mixing by age and race (detailed in Table 1 of the\
  \ manuscript). These measures are aggregated to population-level statistics (for\
  \ a standardized population of 10,000 MSM per city, weighted by race-ethnicity distributions),\
  \ which act as targets for fitting the network models.\n2.  **Model Structure**:\
  \ Three distinct network models are estimated for each city:\n    *   A cross-sectional\
  \ ERGM for one-time partnerships.\n    *   A TERGM for main partnerships (modeling\
  \ formation and dissolution).\n    *   A TERGM for casual partnerships (modeling\
  \ formation and dissolution).\n3.  **Simulation**: Using the parameters estimated\
  \ from these fitted models, complete, multilayer dynamic networks are simulated.\
  \ The simulation proceeds in weekly time steps for 5 years. A closed population\
  \ of 10,000 nodes (individuals) is assumed. The network has three layers (one for\
  \ each partnership type) with a shared node set but unique edge sets per layer.\
  \ Dependencies between layers are captured through 'cross-network' terms. The layers\
  \ are simulated sequentially at each weekly time step.\n4.  **Outcome**: The primary\
  \ outcome derived from these simulated dynamic networks is the Forward-Reachable\
  \ Path (FRP), estimated weekly for each node.\n5.  **Software**: The study utilized\
  \ Statnet R packages and EpiModel for network model estimation and simulation.\n\
  While the manuscript describes the type of models and the process, it does not provide\
  \ the specific mathematical formulations of all ERGM/TERGM terms used or the estimated\
  \ values of their coefficients in the main text. It mentions that some additional\
  \ details on network measures used in the model are in an eAppendix."

- description: Generative parameters (coefficients) for the terms in the Exponential
    Random Graph Models (ERGMs) and Temporal ERGMs (TERGMs). These terms define the
    likelihood of partnership formation and dissolution based on network configurations
    (e.g., number of edges, degree distribution), nodal attributes (e.g., age, race
    for assortative mixing), and partnership duration dynamics (for TERGMs). The specific
    set of ERGM/TERGM terms included in each of the three models (one-time, main,
    casual) and their estimated values are not detailed in the provided manuscript
    text. eAppendices are referenced for some model input details.

  reason: This paper is relevant as it addresses methods for inferring social network
    models (like ERGMs/TERGMs) from egocentrically sampled data, the type of data
    used (ARTnet) in the manuscript to parameterize the pair-formation models.
