description: 'The manuscript describes a deterministic compartmental model of HIV
  transmission among homosexual men, based on ordinary differential equations (ODEs)
  previously defined in Xiridou et al. [16] and extended in this study. The model
  categorizes homosexual men by HIV infection status (susceptible/X0, Primary HIV
  Infection/X1, Chronic HIV Infection/X2) and partnership status (single or in a steady
  pair).


  Steady partnership dynamics:

  - Singles form steady partnerships at a rate ρ. Partners are chosen proportionally
  based on the availability of different types of singles in the population (e.g.,
  an X0 single forms a pair with an X1 single at a rate proportional to ρ * X0 * X1
  / X_total_singles).

  - Steady partnerships have a mean duration of 1/σ (dissolution rate σ), after which
  individuals return to their respective single pools.


  Casual partnership dynamics:

  - Both single men and men in steady partnerships engage in casual sexual contacts.
  These are modeled as instantaneous events.

  - Single men acquire casual contacts at a rate Ps.

  - Men in steady partnerships acquire casual contacts at a rate Pm.

  - The proportion of casual contacts that are URAI is αa, and UIAI is αb.


  Sexual behavior within steady partnerships:

  - The frequency of URAI is φa acts/year and UIAI is φb acts/year.

  - A parameter (1-θ) exists for reduction in risky casual behavior for uninfected
  men in steady pairs with uninfected partners due to negotiated safety, though its
  specific effect on pair formation rates versus transmission probability within contacts
  needs clarification from the original model [16].


  Population demographics:

  - There is an influx of uninfected single men into the population at a rate v (symbol
  υ in Appendix).

  - Men leave the sexually active population at a rate μ (so 1/μ is the average duration
  of sexual activity).

  - The initial population size is N.


  The model tracks the number of individuals in each single state (X0, X1, X2) and
  in each type of pair (P00, P01, P02, P11, P12, P22, where subscripts denote the
  infection status of the partners). The full system of differential equations is
  provided in the Appendix of the manuscript.'
infection_model: 'Dynamic, deterministic, compartmental model using ODEs. HIV infection
  has two stages: Primary HIV Infection (PHI) and Chronic HIV Infection (CHI). Infectivity
  is higher during PHI. HIV transmission is possible through unprotected receptive
  anal intercourse (URAI) or unprotected insertive anal intercourse (UIAI). Transmission
  probabilities per act depend on the act type, the infection stage of the source
  partner (PHI or CHI), and their HAART status. HAART reduces infectivity and increases
  the time to AIDS development. The model considers treatment initiated during PHI
  or CHI.'
