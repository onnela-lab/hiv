description: 'The manuscript describes a deterministic pair-formation model for heterosexual
  gonorrhea transmission. The population is divided into categories based on 5 partnership
  duration types (1 day, 0.5 months, 2 months, 7.5 months, 9.1 years) and 3 preceding
  gap length types (14 days, 51.6 days, 591.2 days). Individuals cycle sequentially
  between being single and being in partnerships, with no concurrency (overlapping
  partnerships) modeled. The total population size and the number of sexually active
  men and women are assumed to be equal and constant. When a new pair is formed, the
  preceding gap lengths of both the male and female individuals are tracked, resulting
  in 9 sub-compartments for each partnership length category. The rates at which individuals
  form and leave partnerships are defined as the inverse of their mean gap and partnership
  lengths, respectively. Mixing for partnership formation is based on preceding gap
  lengths, controlled by a mixing parameter ε (epsilon), where ε=1 denotes fully assortative
  pairing (e.g., males with short gaps pair only with females with short gaps) and
  ε=0 denotes proportionate mixing based on availability. Individuals can change their
  gap-partnership preference type at the end of a partnership, with a probability
  ''p'' of crossing over to a different gap-partnership combination for the next cycle.
  The model tracks three infection states for individuals (male: subscript l, female:
  subscript m): 1=symptomatic care-seeking, 2=uninfected, and 3=infected but noncare-seeking.
  Recovery from infection returns individuals to a susceptible (uninfected) state.
  Infection acquisition occurs only within partnerships where one partner is infected
  and the other is susceptible. The infection rate per susceptible partner in an S-I
  pair is the product of the per-act transmission probability, the frequency of sexual
  intercourse, and the proportion of acts not protected by consistent condom use.
  The model is implemented as a system of ordinary differential equations (detailed
  in the Appendix) tracking single males (M_ijl), single females (F_ikm), and pairs
  (P_ijklm) based on their partnership length (i), preceding gap lengths (j for male,
  k for female), and infection states (l for male, m for female).'
infection_model: 'Gonorrhea. Individuals can be in one of three states: susceptible
  (uninfected), infected and symptomatic care-seeking, or infected and non-care-seeking.
  Recovery rates differ for symptomatic and non-care-seeking individuals and can differ
  by sex for symptomatic cases. Transmission occurs only within discordant pairs.
  The transmission probability per partnership depends on the per-sex-act transmission
  probability (gender-specific), frequency of intercourse (partnership-type specific),
  and condom use.'
