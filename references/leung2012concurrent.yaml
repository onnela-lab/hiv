description: "The manuscript presents a pair-formation model for dynamic concurrent\
  \ partnership networks incorporating demography. \n1. Population: The model considers\
  \ a population with demographic turnover, where individuals are born (recruited)\
  \ at a rate that balances death, maintaining a constant population size. Individuals\
  \ die at a rate μ. All individuals are initially assumed to have the same maximum\
  \ partnership capacity 'n'. Individuals are born with zero partners.\n2. Individual\
  \ State: The state of an individual is defined by 'k', the current number of partners\
  \ (0 ≤ k ≤ n).\n3. Partnership Formation: Partnership formation is supply-driven.\
  \ A free binding site (an individual in state 'k' has 'n-k' free sites) becomes\
  \ occupied at a rate proportional to 'F', the population-level fraction of free\
  \ binding sites. The rate for an individual to transition from state 'k' to 'k+1'\
  \ is (n-k)ρF, where ρ is a rate constant for partnership formation.\n4. Partnership\
  \ Dissolution: An existing partnership dissolves either due to separation (at rate\
  \ σ per partnership) or due to the death of one of the partners. Since the partner's\
  \ death rate is also μ, an occupied binding site becomes free at a rate (σ + μ).\
  \ Thus, an individual in state 'k' transitions to 'k-1' at a rate k(σ+μ).\n5. Dynamics\
  \ of F: The fraction of free binding sites, F(t), evolves according to the differential\
  \ equation: dF/dt = μ + (σ + μ)(1-F) - ρF^2 - μF. The model analyzes the steady-state\
  \ where F(t) converges to a constant F_bar, given by the non-negative solution to\
  \ μ + (σ + μ)(1-F_bar) - ρ(F_bar)^2 - μF_bar = 0.\n6. Steady-State Partner Distribution:\
  \ At steady state (with constant F_bar), the probability ε(a) that a specific binding\
  \ site of an individual is occupied at age 'a' (given the individual is alive) is\
  \ derived from dε/da = ρF_bar(1-ε) - (σ+μ)ε, with ε(0)=0. The solution is ε(a) =\
  \ (ρF_bar / (ρF_bar + σ + μ)) * (1 - exp(-(ρF_bar + σ + μ)a)). The number of partners\
  \ for an individual of age 'a', pk(a), follows a binomial distribution: pk(a) =\
  \ (n choose k) * ε(a)^k * (1-ε(a))^(n-k). The overall stationary distribution of\
  \ partners in the population, Pk, is obtained by averaging pk(a) over the exponential\
  \ lifetime distribution (μ*exp(-μa)): Pk = μ ∫[0,∞] pk(a)exp(-μa)da.\n7. Network\
  \ Type: The primary model focuses on a homosexual population (unimodal network),\
  \ though generalizations to heterosexual populations are discussed.\n8. Time: The\
  \ model is formulated in continuous time, using Markov chains at the individual\
  \ level and ordinary differential equations for population-level quantities."

    which a partnership dissolves due to a partner's death.

  symbol: μ
population_structure: The main model assumes a homogeneous population where all individuals
  have the same partnership capacity 'n'. Demographic turnover (birth at rate μ, death
  at rate μ) implies an age structure, but individuals are not explicitly stratified
  by pre-defined groups like age or sexual activity level a priori.
