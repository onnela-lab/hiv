description: 'The model simulates partnership formation and dissolution among a population
  of YMSM (Young Men who have Sex with Men). It is a discrete-time, stochastic, agent-based
  model.

  Partnership Types:

  1.  ''Within-partnerships'': Between two YMSM agents in the simulation. These are
  modeled as explicit ties in a dynamic network.

  2.  ''Outside-partnerships'': Between a YMSM agent and an external partner (older
  MSM or female). These are modeled as attributes of the YMSM agent, not explicit
  network ties with external agents. Their characteristics (e.g., HIV status) are
  based on prevalence data.

  3.  ''One-night partnerships'': Casual, short-term partnerships. Also modeled as
  attributes of the YMSM agent.

  Both ''outside'' and ''one-night'' partnerships depend on individual YMSM attributes
  and their current number of ''within-partnerships'' (sexual momentary degree).


  Formation:

  - YMSM agents have a sexual tendency (based on sexual orientation, desired sex role,
  desired sex frequency) influencing partner choice. Sexual orientation affects whether
  partners are male or female.

  - Partnership formation rates are parameterized using multivariate regression models
  based on data from the Crew 450 longitudinal study of YMSM.

  - Upon formation, partnership attributes (e.g., seriousness, oral-sex only, mean
  length, propensity for unprotected intercourse, race/sex of outside/one-night partners)
  are assigned based on probability estimates derived from regression models using
  Crew 450 data.


  Dissolution:

  - ''Within-'' and ''outside-'' partnerships dissolve at each time step based on
  a probability. This probability is determined by the mean duration specific to that
  partnership type.

  - ''One-night partnerships'' are implicitly short-lived by definition.


  The model is parameterized using empirical data from the Crew 450 study, with specific
  values for formation rates, mean durations, and attribute probabilities detailed
  in the manuscript''s Supplemental Digital Content. Actual sexual behavior within
  partnerships is modeled as a function of the sexual tendencies of both partners
  and overall cohort behavior.'
infection_model: Simultaneous HIV, gonorrhea (NG), and chlamydia (CT) spread. Transmission
  via penile-vaginal or anal intercourse. Oral sex transmission not modeled. HIV infectiousness
  varies by time since infection, ART use, viral suppression, and race. NG/CT infections
  (urethral or rectal) increase HIV susceptibility/transmissibility. NG/CT infections
  are independent of each other and HIV/ART.

population_structure: Structured by age (YMSM 16-21.8 years at baseline, with aging-in,
  aging-out, and death processes) and race/ethnicity (Black, Latino, White, Other).
  Model includes 'outside partners' who can be older MSM or female, characterized
  by age and sex.
