description: 'The manuscript presents a deterministic compartmental pair-formation
  model for infectious diseases that confer long-lasting immunity after recovery,
  extending the Kretzschmar and Dietz (1998) framework. The model tracks single individuals
  in Susceptible (S), Infectious (I), and Recovered (R) states, and six types of pairs:
  Susceptible-Susceptible (P_SS), Susceptible-Infectious (P_SI), Infectious-Infectious
  (P_II), Susceptible-Recovered (P_SR), Infectious-Recovered (P_IR), and Recovered-Recovered
  (P_RR).


  Key model dynamics:

  1.  Population entry: New individuals enter the S class at a constant rate B.

  2.  Natural mortality: All single individuals experience natural mortality at a
  rate μ. Paired individuals also experience mortality, effectively removing them
  from the pair and potentially the system, at rate μ per individual (2μ for the pair).

  3.  Pair formation: Single individuals form pairs at a rate ρ. The rate of formation
  for a specific pair type (e.g., S with S) is proportional to the product of the
  densities of the constituent single types, normalized by N (total singles, N=S+I+R).
  For example, dP_SS/dt formation term is ρ*S*S/N; dP_SI/dt formation term is ρ*2*S*I/N.

  4.  Pair dissolution: Pairs dissolve at a rate σ, with individuals returning to
  their respective single compartments.

  5.  Transmission within pairs: In P_SI pairs, transmission from the infectious to
  the susceptible partner occurs at a rate φ*h, where φ is the contact rate within
  the partnership potentially leading to transmission, and h is the probability of
  transmission per such contact. This converts a P_SI pair into a P_II pair.

  6.  Recovery: Infectious individuals (single I, or an I in a P_SI, P_II, or P_IR
  pair) recover at a rate δ. Recovery of a single I moves it to R. Recovery of an
  I in a pair changes the pair type (e.g., P_SI becomes P_SR; one I in P_II recovers
  to form P_IR; the I in P_IR recovers to form P_RR). Recovered individuals (R) are
  assumed to have long-lasting immunity.


  The model is defined by a system of nine ordinary differential equations (Equations
  1-9, page 2 of the manuscript):

  dS/dt = B – (μ + ρ)S + (σ + μ)(2P_SS + P_SI + P_SR)

  dI/dt = – (μ + ρ + δ)I + (σ + μ)(2P_II + P_SI + P_IR)

  dR/dt = –(μ + ρ)R + δI + (σ + μ)(2P_RR + P_SR + P_IR)

  dP_SS/dt = ρ(S^2/N) – (σ + 2μ)P_SS

  dP_SI/dt = ρ(2SI/N) – (σ + φh + 2μ + δ)P_SI

  dP_II/dt = ρ(I^2/N) + φhP_SI – (σ + 2μ + 2δ)P_II

  dP_SR/dt = ρ(2SR/N) + δP_SI – (σ + 2μ)P_SR

  dP_IR/dt = ρ(2IR/N) + δP_II – (σ + 2μ + δ)P_IR

  dP_RR/dt = ρ(R^2/N) + δP_IR – (σ + 2μ)P_RR

  where N = S + I + R (total number of single individuals). For the mpox application,
  parameters B and μ were set to 0 due to the short outbreak timescale.'
