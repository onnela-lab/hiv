description: 'The manuscript presents a deterministic, continuous-time, compartmental
  pair-formation model for sexually transmitted infections (STIs), specifically using
  Chlamydia trachomatis as an example. The population is structured into singles and
  pairs. Individuals transition from single to paired status at a rate ρ (pair formation
  rate) and pairs dissolve at a rate σ (separation rate) or due to mortality (μ).
  The model equations (System of ODEs 1) describe the dynamics of the proportion of
  singles (X) and pairs (P, where X+2P=1 for the simplified, non-sex-stratified version).


  For the STI dynamics, the model is an SIRS (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Susceptible)
  type. It explicitly distinguishes between males and females. Individuals can be
  single females (Xf), single males (Xm), or in pairs (P_xy, where x is female status,
  y is male status). Infection states are Susceptible (S), Infected (I), and Recovered
  (R). Transmission occurs within discordant pairs (e.g., SI) with a probability β
  per sex act, and φ sex acts per week. Infected individuals recover naturally at
  sex-specific rates (γf for females, γm for males). Recovered individuals lose immunity
  at a rate ε and return to the susceptible state. A key feature is the modeling of
  re-infection, both of a partner by an index case within an ongoing partnership,
  and of an index case by their partner if the index case recovers while the partner
  is still infectious. The full system of ODEs (System of ODEs 2) tracks the proportions
  of individuals in each sex/infection state category for singles (e.g., Xf,S, Xm,I)
  and pairs (e.g., P_SI, P_II). The total population N = Xf + Xm + 2P = 1. The model
  is used to derive and analyze three reproduction numbers: Ro (basic reproduction
  number), Rc (case reproduction number), and Rp (partnership reproduction number).
  The baseline model assumes homogeneous sexual behavior, with an extension to heterogeneous
  sexual behavior (low/high activity classes) discussed in Appendix B.'

  Natural clearance of infection. Loss of immunity leading to S. Re-infection within
