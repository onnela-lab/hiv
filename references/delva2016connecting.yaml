description: 'The manuscript is a review that discusses approaches to network modeling
  in HIV epidemiology, rather than presenting a single, specific, and fully detailed
  pair formation model. It describes two main frameworks within which pair formation
  is modeled:

  1. Agent-Based Models (ABMs): In these models, the social network, including the
  formation and dissolution of partnerships, emerges from ''behavioural and biological
  rules'' specified by the analyst at the level of individual agents [59]. These rules
  dictate partner choice, relationship initiation, and termination. The manuscript
  cites ''Simpact'' [23] as an example of an ABM tool for simulating HIV transmission
  in dynamic sexual networks (Figure 1). However, the specific algorithms or parameterizations
  for pair formation rules within Simpact or other ABMs (e.g., precise functions for
  partner selection, distributions for relationship durations) are not detailed in
  this manuscript.

  2. Exponential Random Graph Models (ERGMs): ERGMs are statistical models used to
  describe network structures. They can be fitted to observed network data (often
  from egocentric surveys) to understand population-level patterns such as homophily
  or concurrency [44]. Subsequently, complete networks can be *generated* based on
  a fitted ERGM, and these synthetic networks are then used for simulating HIV epidemics
  [39, 46]. In this approach, pair formation is implicitly governed by the probabilities
  of ties derived from the ERGM specification, reflecting the observed structural
  properties. The manuscript does not provide specific ERGM equations or detailed
  parameter sets for a pair formation model.


  In summary, while the manuscript explains the concepts and refers to methodologies
  and tools that incorporate pair formation, it does not provide sufficient detail
  (e.g., specific equations, algorithms, or a full list of parameters with values)
  to reproduce a particular pair formation model implementation directly from its
  text.'
infection_model: HIV transmission model. The manuscript discusses simulating HIV epidemics
  on the modeled networks. This implies an underlying model of HIV transmission, where
  individuals can transmit or acquire infection based on network connections and other
  factors. Relevant aspects mentioned include viral load (e.g., SPVL in Figure 1a)
  and condom use (page 2). Specific details of the infection model (e.g., transmission
  probabilities per act, disease progression stages, effect of ART) are not provided
  in this review.
network_type: bimodal
parameters:
- description: Parameters for an Exponential Random Graph Model (ERGM). These parameters
    (coefficients) quantify the effect of various network configurations (e.g., number
    of edges, degree distribution, homophily based on attributes, concurrency) on
    the likelihood of a network. They are estimated from data and then used to generate
    synthetic networks. Specific symbols or estimates are not provided.
  estimate: unknown
  location: Page 4 (general discussion of ERGMs)
  symbol: unknown (conceptual, e.g., ERGM coefficients)
- description: Parameters defining the behavioural and biological rules for pair formation
    and dissolution in an Agent-Based Model (ABM). These could include probabilities
    of relationship formation, parameters governing partner choice functions (e.g.,
    based on age or other attributes), and parameters for relationship duration distributions.
    Specific symbols or estimates are not provided.
  estimate: unknown
  location: Page 4 (general discussion of ABMs, e.g., Simpact [23])
  symbol: unknown (conceptual, e.g., rates, probabilities)
population_structure: The models discussed can incorporate structured populations.
  Structure can be based on various individual attributes such as gender (Figure 1
  shows male and female agents), race, ethnicity, age, sexual activity level, and
  membership in key populations (e.g., men who have sex with men, sex workers, injecting
  drug users). Network formation can be influenced by these attributes, for example,
  through homophilous mixing (preference for partners with similar characteristics).
