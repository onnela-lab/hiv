description: "The manuscript presents a pair-formation model for sexually transmitted\
  \ diseases, formulated as a system of ordinary differential equations. \n\n1. Basic\
  \ Model (Section 1, Eq 1.1): This model describes a heterosexual population with\
  \ densities of single females (x), single males (y), and pairs (p).\n   dx/dt =\
  \ κx - μxx + (μy + σ)p – φ(x, y)\n   dy/dt = κy - μyy + (μx + σ)p – φ(x, y)\n  \
  \ dp/dt = –(μx + μy + σ)p + φ(x, y)\n   Parameters include recruitment rates (κx,\
  \ κy), mortality rates (μx, μy, assumed same for singles and those in pairs), and\
  \ a pair separation rate (σ). The function φ(x, y) represents the pair formation\
  \ rate. It is assumed to be non-negative, homogeneous of degree one (i.e., φ(αx,\
  \ αy) = αφ(x,y)), increasing in both variables, and symmetric (φ(x,y) = φ(y,x)).\
  \ Specific forms like the harmonic mean (φ(x,y) = 2ρxy/(x+y)) and the minimum function\
  \ (φ(x,y) = ρ min(x,y)) are discussed, where ρ is a proportionality constant.\n\n\
  2. Extended Model with Infection (Section 2, Eq 2.4): This model builds upon the\
  \ basic framework to include infection dynamics. The population is categorized into\
  \ eight types: single noninfected females (x0), single noninfected males (y0), single\
  \ infected females (x1), single infected males (y1), and four types of pairs based\
  \ on the infection status of partners (p00: S-S, p01: S-female/I-male, p10: I-female/S-male,\
  \ p11: I-I).\n   Pair formation is described by functions Φij (the rate of encounters\
  \ between females of type i and males of type j, where i,j ∈ {0,1} correspond to\
  \ susceptible and infected status). The manuscript primarily uses a minimum law\
  \ for these functions, which, assuming an excess of females (total single females\
  \ s(X) = x0+x1), takes the form:\n   Φij(x0, y0, x1, y1) = (ρij * xi * yj) / (x0+x1)\
  \ (derived from Eq 2.3, where ρij are constants).\n   The system of 8 ODEs (Eq 2.4,\
  \ p7) accounts for:\n   - Recruitment into susceptible single classes (κx, κy).\n\
  \   - Mortality rates dependent on sex and infection status (μx0, μy0, μx1, μy1).\n\
  \   - Recovery from infection for single individuals (rates γx, γy).\n   - Separation\
  \ rates for each pair type (σij).\n   - Formation of new pairs. For example, the\
  \ term +Φ00 appears in the equation for dp00/dt.\n   - Transmission of infection:\
  \ \n     a) At pair formation: An encounter between a susceptible (e.g., x0) and\
  \ an infected individual (e.g., y1) at rate Φ01 can result in an S-I pair (p01)\
  \ if transmission does not occur (e.g., with probability 1-hy), or an I-I pair (p11)\
  \ if transmission occurs (e.g., with probability hy). This is modeled by terms like\
  \ (1-hy)Φ01 in dp01/dt and hyΦ01 in dp11/dt.\n     b) Within existing pairs: Infection\
  \ can spread within a pair at a rate β (sexual contacts within a pair), with per-contact\
  \ transmission probabilities hx (infected female to susceptible male) and hy (infected\
  \ male to susceptible female). This is modeled by terms like -hyβp01 (loss of p01\
  \ as susceptible female gets infected) and +hyβp01 (gain of p11 from newly infected\
  \ female in a former p01 pair).\n   - Change of pair type due to recovery of a partner\
  \ within a pair."
infection_model: The infection model is an SIS-type (Susceptible-Infective-Susceptible)
  model, as individuals can recover from infection and become susceptible again (terms
  with γx, γy). Infection is transmitted through sexual contact. Transmission can
  occur at the point of pair formation or during the existence of a pair. Parameters
  governing infection include the rate of sexual contacts within a pair (β), per-contact
  transmission probabilities (hx for F->M, hy for M->F), and recovery rates (γx, γy).
