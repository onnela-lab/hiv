description: "The manuscript describes a stochastic, discrete-time Markov model for\
  \ pair formation and dissolution. At each time step (1 day), new partnerships are\
  \ formed and existing partnerships are dissolved. The total number of partnerships\
  \ in the population fluctuates randomly around a constant average, which is the\
  \ same for all scenarios. New partnerships form with a rate rho (p), which depends\
  \ on the number of partnerships already present. Existing partnerships separate\
  \ with a constant rate sigma (o).\n\nThe momentary distribution of partnerships\
  \ is varied to represent different scenarios: \n1. Sequential monogamy: Individuals\
  \ have at most one partner at a time. The attraction function for pair formation\
  \ is 0 if either of the two randomly chosen nodes is already linked.\n2. Concurrent\
  \ partnerships: The momentary number of partners per individual is randomly distributed,\
  \ up to a maximum. The attraction function varies with the degree homophily bias.\
  \ If a link is not formed between two chosen nodes, new nodes are drawn until a\
  \ pair is formed. This continues until the required number of new partnerships (calculated\
  \ based on preserving the mean degree) is formed.\n\nMixing patterns (degree-based\
  \ homophily bias) are also explored: random, assortative (similar degrees partner),\
  \ and disassortative (different degrees partner)."
infection_model: Disease transmission occurs within discordant pairs (one susceptible,
  one infected) at a constant rate per day (infectivity). One person is randomly infected
  at t=0. There is no recovery or disease-related mortality.
