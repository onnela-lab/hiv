description: "The manuscript describes a stochastic, dynamic, population-based simulation\
  \ model for the formation and separation of partnerships in a heterosexual population\
  \ to study Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) transmission and screening. The model population\
  \ consists of 10,000 individuals (1:1 sex ratio) aged 15-64 years, with a uniform\
  \ age distribution. Individuals exit at 65 and are replaced by 15-year-olds. The\
  \ model stratifies by sex, 5-year age groups, sexual activity level (high/low),\
  \ partnership type (steady/casual), and CT infection status (asymptomatic/symptomatic).\
  \ \nIndividuals in the 'high sexual activity' (core) group, comprising 5% of the\
  \ 15-34 age group, can have multiple casual partners alongside at most one steady\
  \ partner and exhibit a higher propensity for forming casual partnerships. Those\
  \ not in the core group maintain at most one partner (steady or casual) at any time.\
  \ \nPartnership dynamics are characterized by average durations: 6.9 years for steady\
  \ partnerships and 10 days for casual partnerships. Sexual intercourse frequency\
  \ also varies by partnership type: 0.25 times per day in steady partnerships and\
  \ 1.0 time per day in casual partnerships. \nThe underlying parameters for sexual\
  \ behavior and partnership characteristics are primarily drawn from a 1989 Dutch\
  \ survey (Ref 20), with some modifications (Ref 19). The detailed structure of this\
  \ epidemiologic model, including the pair formation aspects, is referenced to Kretzschmar\
  \ et al., 1996 (Ref 56). Full reproduction of the model implementation would likely\
  \ require consulting these primary references."
infection_model: Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) transmission model. Key aspects include
  a CT transmission probability per sexual contact, differentiation between asymptomatic
  and symptomatic infection, and an average infectious period of 1 year for CT. The
  model simulates the spread of CT through the explicitly modeled sexual contact network.

population_structure: Structured by sex (male, female), age (5-year age groups from
  15 to 64), sexual activity level (high activity 'core group' and low activity 'non-core
  group'), and type of partnership (steady, casual). The core group is defined as
  5% of the 15-34 year age group.
