description: 'The manuscript describes a stochastic simulation model for HIV population
  dynamics using complex networks. The pair-formation aspect, central to sexual transmission,
  is modeled differently for various risk groups:

  1.  **MSM and Heterosexual Populations**: These are modeled using dynamic scale-free
  networks. The network structure is regenerated at each discrete time step (implicitly
  yearly). This regeneration uses a configuration model: links are formed between
  nodes based on a degree sequence drawn from a power-law distribution P(k) ~ k^-γ
  (where k is the number of partners), up to a maximum k_max. The heterosexual network
  is specifically a bipartite graph. The parameters γ (power-law exponent) and k_max
  (maximum degree) define the network topology and are specific to MSM and heterosexual
  groups. This network regeneration (evolutionary operator Γ2) represents the dynamic
  nature of sexual partnerships.

  2.  **IDU Population**: For injection drug users, the model assumes homogeneous
  mixing within the group, rather than a specific network-based pair-formation mechanism.


  The overall model is defined by {G, Γ}, where G=(V,E) is the graph and Γ is the
  evolutionary operator governing changes in discrete time steps: (V,E)t+1 = Γ(V,E)t.
  The operator Γ is a composition of sub-operators for infection spreading (Γ1), network
  link dynamics (Γ2 - the pair formation aspect), demographic changes (Γ3), and HIV
  disease progression/removal (Γ4).'
infection_model: 'HIV infection progression is modeled as a multi-stage Markov process.
  Infected individuals transition through states defined by their CD4 T-lymphocyte
  counts (four stages: >500, 350-499, 200-349, <200 cells/microliter). Individuals
  reaching the final stage (AIDS, CD4 < 200) are considered ''removed'' from the network
  in terms of transmission. HIV transmission occurs from an infected node to a susceptible
  connected neighbor with a probability λ (lambda) per link, per year. This parameter
  λ is tuned for different risk groups (MSM, heterosexual, IDU). For heterosexual
  transmission, the probability from males to females is assumed to be twice that
  from females to males. The infection spreading process itself is represented by
  operator Γ1.'

population_structure: 'The population is structured into three main risk groups: men
  who have sex with men (MSM), heterosexual population, and injection drug users (IDU).
  These groups are modeled independently. Demographic changes (births/deaths or entry/exit
  from risk group) are incorporated via demographic coefficients (d1, d2). Age structure
  is implicitly considered, for instance, when discussing demographic coefficients
  for the 15-39 age group (Section 3.3).'
