description: 'The manuscript presents a family of "edge-based compartmental models"
  for SIR infectious disease spread on networks. The core idea is to track θ(t) (or
  Θ(t) for expected degree models), the probability that a randomly selected edge
  (partnership) connected to a test individual has *not* transmitted the infection
  to that individual. The overall proportions of susceptible (S), infected (I), and
  recovered (R) individuals in the population are then derived from θ(t) using the
  (expected) degree distribution''s generating function (ψ or Ψ).

  The dynamics of θ(t) (and related auxiliary variables representing the state of
  the partner on the other end of the edge) are described by systems of ordinary differential
  equations (ODEs). These ODEs account for infection transmission across the edge
  (at rate β), recovery of partners (at rate γ), and, in dynamic network models, the
  processes of partnership formation and dissolution (governed by rates like η, η1,
  η2).

  The paper details several specific models:

  1. Configuration Model (CM): Static network with a given degree distribution P(k).
  (Section 2, Eq. 2.1)

  2. Mean Field Social Heterogeneity (MFSH - Actual Degree): Dynamic network, degrees
  P(k), partners rewire instantly. (Section 3.1, Eq. 3.1)

  3. Dynamic Fixed-Degree (DFD): Dynamic network, degrees P(k), edges break and re-form
  at rate η. (Section 3.2, Eqs. 3.5-3.8)

  4. Dormant Contact (DC): Dynamic network, degrees P(k_m), edges break (rate η2),
  stubs can be dormant, then re-form edges (rate η1). (Section 3.3, Eqs. 3.11-3.18)

  5. Mixed Poisson (MP): Static network with expected degree distribution ρ(κ). (Section
  4.1, equation for Θ_dot on p.11)

  6. MFSH (Expected Degree): Dynamic network, expected degrees ρ(κ), partners rewire
  instantly. (Section 4.2, equation for Θ_dot on p.12)

  7. Dynamic Variable-Degree (DVD): Dynamic network, expected degrees ρ(κ), edges
  form and break at rates proportional to κη and η respectively. (Section 4.3, Eqs.
  4.1-4.3)

  These models allow for heterogeneous contact rates (via degree distributions) and
  varying partnership durations.'
