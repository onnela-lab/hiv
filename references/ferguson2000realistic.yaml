description: "The manuscript presents deterministic ordinary differential equation\
  \ (ODE) models for heterosexual pair formation and sexually transmitted disease\
  \ (STD) dynamics. Two main models are described:\n\n1.  **Simple Pair Model (Serial\
  \ Monogamy)**:\n    *   Tracks single males (m0), single females (f0), and monogamous\
  \ pairs (p1,1).\n    *   Pair formation occurs between single individuals at a rate\
  \ proportional to Φ0,0 * m0 * f0.\n    *   Pairs dissolve at a rate ν. Individuals\
  \ also die at a rate μ.\n    *   Equations (1) on page 2 detail these dynamics without\
  \ infection.\n    *   Infection (Susceptible 'S', Infected 'I') is introduced by\
  \ stratifying individuals (mS0, mI0, fS0, fI0) and pairs (pSS1,1, pSI1,1, pIS1,1,\
  \ pII1,1).\n    *   Transmission occurs within discordant pairs (rate β). Recovery\
  \ occurs at rate σ.\n\n2.  **Extended Pair Model (Concurrency)**:\n    *   Allows\
  \ individuals to have up to MP concurrent partners.\n    *   State variables include\
  \ mi (males with i partners), fj (females with j partners), and pij (pairs where\
  \ male has i partners, female has j partners).\n    *   Partnership dynamics are\
  \ more complex, involving:\n        *   Formation of new pairs between individuals\
  \ based on their current number of partners (i, j), governed by rates Φi,j.\n  \
  \      *   Formation of new partnerships by individuals already in other partnerships,\
  \ which changes their partner count i or j.\n        *   Dissolution of existing\
  \ partnerships (rate ν for a specific pair).\n        *   Changes in i or j for\
  \ a pair pij if one member loses/gains an *external* partner.\n        *   Death\
  \ of individuals (rate μ).\n    *   The model considers higher-order structures\
  \ like triples (Ui,j,k for male-centered, Vi,j,k for female-centered) which represent\
  \ two partnerships sharing a common individual. The number of such triples is estimated\
  \ using a **moment closure approximation** (Equation 10, page 5), assuming statistical\
  \ independence of pairs forming a triple, conditional on the central individual.\n\
  \    *   Infection (S, I) is included by stratifying all states (individuals, pairs\
  \ pABij, triples UABC, VABC).\n        *   Transmission occurs within discordant\
  \ pairs (rate β).\n        *   Transmission can also occur from an infected concurrent\
  \ partner who is not part of the focal pair (Equations 11-14, page 5), with rates\
  \ dependent on β and the number of relevant infected triples.\n    *   Recovery\
  \ from infection occurs at rate σ.\n    *   The detailed ODEs for the extended model\
  \ with infection are provided in the Appendix (page 10). The term ΛABij in these\
  \ equations encapsulates the complex partnership formation, dissolution, and partner\
  \ number change dynamics for pairs of type pABij."
infection_model: SI (Susceptible-Infected) model. Individuals are either susceptible
  or infected. Transmission occurs within discordant partnerships or from an infected
  concurrent partner (in the extended model). Infected individuals recover to the
  susceptible state at a specific rate. No latency or explicit immunity is modeled,
  though it's mentioned that asymptomatic states could be added.

    described in the manuscript builds upon such pair models by incorporating concurrency
    and moment closure techniques. This reference likely introduces foundational concepts
    of pair modeling for STDs relevant to the manuscript's methods section on 'Simple

  reason: Explicitly cited as a developer of an earlier pair model (page 1). This
    work on pair formation is directly relevant to the core concept of modeling partnerships
    as states, which is fundamental to both the simple and extended pair models presented
    in the manuscript. It likely discusses the explicit representation of partnerships
    which the manuscript adopts and extends for concurrency using moment closure for
    triples which arise from individuals in multiple pairs simultaneously.
