description: "The manuscript describes a stochastic, discrete-time, agent-based simulation\
  \ model to study the effects of concurrent partnerships on epidemic spread. The\
  \ population consists of N individuals with a 1:1 male-female ratio. Each individual\
  \ is characterized by disease status (Susceptible or Infected), current number of\
  \ partners (degree), and the identities of their partners.\n\nThe simulation proceeds\
  \ in discrete time steps (1 day). In each time step, the following events occur\
  \ in sequence:\n\n1.  **Pair Formation:** \n    The number of potential new partnerships\
  \ to be formed in this time step is `n = N/2 - P(t)`, where `P(t)` is the current\
  \ total number of active pairs. The model attempts to form `n` new pairs. For each\
  \ of these `n` attempts:\n    a.  **Partner Selection using Mixing Function (φ):**\
  \ A pair of potential partners (one male `x`, one female `y`) is selected. This\
  \ selection process involves repeatedly drawing random males and females until a\
  \ pair is found for which a stochastic condition based on the mixing function `φ(x,y)`\
  \ is met. The mixing function `φ(x,y)` represents the probability that individuals\
  \ `x` and `y` will form a partnership upon encounter, based on their current degrees.\
  \ The specific procedure is: \n        i.  Draw a random male (`x_candidate`) and\
  \ a random female (`y_candidate`).\n        ii. Calculate `φ(x_candidate, y_candidate)`\
  \ based on their current degrees using one of the specified mixing functions (Serial\
  \ Monogamy, Random, Assortative, or Disassortative - see Equations 40-43).\n   \
  \     iii. A random number is drawn; if it's less than `φ(x_candidate, y_candidate)`,\
  \ then `x_candidate` and `y_candidate` are selected as the partners for this attempt.\
  \ Otherwise, repeat from step (i) until such a pair is selected.\n    b.  **Partnership\
  \ Actualization:** Once a pair (`x`, `y`) has been selected through the process\
  \ above, this pair forms an actual partnership with probability `p` (pair-formation\
  \ probability).\n\n    Different mixing functions `φ(x,y)` are used to model different\
  \ partnership patterns:\n    *   **Serial Monogamy (Eq 40):** `φ(x,y) = 1` if `deg(x)\
  \ = 0` and `deg(y) = 0` (both are single), and `0` otherwise.\n    *   **Random\
  \ Mixing (Eq 41):** `φ(x,y) = 1` if `deg(x) = 0` and `deg(y) = 0`; otherwise `1-ξ`.\
  \ `ξ` is a parameter ranging from 0 (pure random distribution of partnerships) to\
  \ 1 (serial monogamy).\n    *   **Assortative Mixing (Eq 42):** `φ(x,y) = (1-ξ)\
  \ + ξ * (deg(x) * deg(y) / d_max^2)`, where `d_max` is the maximum possible degree.\n\
  \    *   **Disassortative Mixing (Eq 43):** `φ(x,y) = (1-ξ) + ξ * ((deg(x) - deg(y))\
  \ / d_max)^2`.\n\n2.  **Disease Transmission:** \n    For every existing partnership\
  \ between a susceptible (S) individual and an infected (I) individual, disease transmission\
  \ from I to S occurs with probability `λ` within that time step. The model is an\
  \ SI (Susceptible-Infected) model, meaning there is no recovery from infection.\n\
  \n3.  **Pair Separation:** \n    Every existing partnership dissolves with probability\
  \ `σ` in each time step.\n\nThe model aims to keep the mean number of partners per\
  \ individual constant across simulations by setting the number of new partnership\
  \ formation attempts to `n = N/2 - P(t)`, effectively limiting total partnerships\
  \ to N/2. Demographic processes and recovery from infection are excluded."
