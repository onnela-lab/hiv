description: 'The manuscript primarily uses deterministic compartmental Ordinary Differential
  Equation (ODE) models to represent pair formation and dissolution implicitly through
  rates of partner change and mixing matrices in a structured population. The main
  model for this purpose is detailed in Appendix C (page S161).

  The population is heterosexual and stratified by sex (k) and sexual activity class
  (i). Individuals in sex k, activity class i, acquire new partners at a rate c_ki.
  Partner choice is governed by a mixing matrix P_kij, which defines the probability
  that an individual of sex k in group i forms a partnership with an individual of
  the opposite sex (k'') in activity class j. The rate of new infections is proportional
  to c_ki * X_ki * (sum over j of P_kij * Y_k''j / N_k''j), representing new partnerships
  formed between susceptible individuals and infected individuals from different groups.

  Partnership duration is not explicitly tracked per pair but is implicitly handled
  through the partner change rates (c_ki) and recovery rates (ν).

  Different mixing patterns for P_kij are discussed, including fully assortative,
  random (P_ij = N_jc_j / Σ(N_ucu_u)), and a parameterized form P_ij = (1-ε)δ_ij +
  ε(N_jc_j / Σ(N_ucu_u)) (Equation 7, page S154), where ε controls the degree of assortative
  mixing (ε=0 for fully assortative, ε=1 for random within this formulation).

  Appendix A (page S160) also describes a simpler homogeneous model where partnerships
  form at rate ''c'' and dissolve at rate ''v'' (Greek nu in Appendix A, distinct
  from recovery rate nu in Appendix C), with transmission occurring within partnerships,
  extending the work of Watts and May [6].'
infection_model: Compartmental model (SIS-like for gonorrhea as in Appendix A and
  C, with extensions for an immune class Z in Appendix D) where individuals can be
  susceptible, infected, and can recover. Transmission occurs within sexual partnerships.
