description: 'The manuscript presents a deterministic compartmental model (PSI model:
  PrEP-treated, Susceptible, Infected) using a system of ordinary differential equations
  (ODEs) to study the effect of Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) on HIV transmission
  among men who have sex with men (MSM). The total population (N0) is assumed constant.
  Individuals are recruited at a rate π, with a fraction α starting PrEP. Susceptible
  individuals (S) can start PrEP (rate θ) moving to state P, or get infected (rate
  λ) moving to I. PrEP users (P) can stop PrEP (rate σ) moving to S, or get infected
  at a reduced rate (1-qr)λ, where q is adherence and r is PrEP effectiveness. All
  individuals are removed from the population at a rate μ. The model does not distinguish
  acute/chronic HIV stages.

  Three partnership scenarios are considered for calculating the infection rate λ:

  1. Casual-only partnerships: λ = λz = z*β*i, where z is the rate of casual partner
  acquisition, β is transmission probability per act, and i is the proportion of infected
  individuals.

  2. Monogamous long-term partnerships: The infection rate λ = λp is derived using
  a linearized expected value for the nonlocal effects of long-term partnerships.
  It is given by λp = (χ*(1+μ*τ)*i) / (1 + χ*τ*(s + (1-q*r)*v)), where χ is the effective
  transmission rate for long-term partnerships (defined as (p/τ)*(1-(1-c*β)^n) on
  p.13, where p/τ is the long-term partner acquisition rate ''p'' from Table 2), τ
  is mean duration of long-term partnerships, s is proportion of susceptible, and
  v is proportion on PrEP.

  3. Non-monogamous long-term partnerships (combination of casual and long-term):
  The infection rate λ is given by λ = ((z*β + χ*(1+μ*τ))*i) / (1 + χ*τ*(s + (1-q*r)*v)).

  The model equations are presented as proportions of the total population (v=P/N0,
  s=S/N0, i=I/N0). Stability of disease-free and endemic equilibria is analyzed.'
infection_model: 'HIV transmission model with three compartments: PrEP-users (P),
  Susceptible (S), and Infected (I). PrEP treatment reduces the probability of infection
  by a factor (1-qr), where q is adherence and r is PrEP effectiveness. Only one stage
  of HIV infection is considered.'
