description: 'The manuscript describes a deterministic, partnership-based mathematical
  model using a system of ordinary differential equations to simulate the HIV epidemic
  among MSM aged 15-64 years in the UK. The modelled population is divided into two
  age groups (15–34 and 35–64 years) and two sexual activity levels (low: ≤1 new partner/year,
  high: >1 new partner/year), creating four MSM classes. MSM are also categorized
  as ''current'' (still acquire new partners) or ''past'' (no longer have sexual relationships
  with men). The model defines two types of sexual partnerships: one-off sexual partnerships
  (single sex act) and repeat sexual partnerships (multiple sex acts with the same
  partner, lasting for a finite duration). MSM in repeat partnerships can also acquire
  one-off partners. Rates for forming and dissolving repeat partnerships, and rates
  for forming one-off partnerships, are stratified by the four MSM classes. Non-random
  mixing between partners based on age group, sexual activity level, and perceived
  HIV serostatus is implemented using an odds ratio method. HIV transmission occurs
  only through sex between men, via unprotected receptive anal intercourse (URAI),
  unprotected insertive anal intercourse (UIAI), and unprotected receptive oral intercourse
  (UROI). Condom use with repeat sexual partners is modelled based on class-specific
  proportions of susceptible individuals who have unprotected anal intercourse (UAI)
  with perceived HIV-negative partners and with diagnosed HIV-positive partners. For
  one-off partnerships, susceptible individuals are categorized into three groups:
  those with no UAI, those with UAI only with a perceived HIV-negative partner, and
  those with UAI with a diagnosed HIV-positive one-off partner. The model was calibrated
  to time series HIV prevalence and validated using multiple surveillance datasets.
  Further details of the model structure and analysis methods are in an Appendix (http://links.lww.com/QAD/A612),
  which was not provided.'
infection_model: The HIV infection model includes a susceptible stage, followed by
  progression through 11 HIV-positive stages. These stages are defined by CD4+ cell
  counts (Primary HIV Infection (PHI), CD4+ ≥500, 350–499, 200–349, and <200 cells/µl),
  HIV diagnosis status (undiagnosed or diagnosed), and ART status (diagnosed individuals
  can move to a treatment stage). Different HIV transmission probabilities are associated
  with each stage, based on average viral load. Transmission probability and plasma
  viral load are related according to a function proposed by Smith and Blower [6].
  Figure 1 provides a schematic representation of these HIV infection stages.
