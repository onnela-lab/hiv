description: "The manuscript describes a network modeling framework for simulating\
  \ the spread of disease through dynamic heterosexual contact networks. The model\
  \ features an open population, where individuals (men and women) enter through maturation\
  \ and exit through aging out or death. Each individual has characteristics like\
  \ age, gender, and disease state.\n\nPartnerships:\n- The model accommodates K different\
  \ types of partnerships (e.g., spousal, non-spousal in the HIV example).\n- The\
  \ state of partnerships at time t is represented by an adjacency matrix A^t.\n-\
  \ Individuals are initialized with a number and type of partnerships drawn from\
  \ empirical gender-specific joint distributions, d_m(k) and d_f(k), where k is a\
  \ vector representing the number of partners of each type. These distributions are\
  \ derived from overall degree distributions (m(p), f(p) - proportion with p total\
  \ partners) and other data (e.g., marriage rates s_m, s_f).\n- Network Initialization:\
  \ A generalized random graph is created using the configuration model. Individuals\
  \ are assigned desired partnership types. Men and women seeking partners of a specific\
  \ type are randomly matched. Duplicate partnerships are avoided by exchanging one\
  \ partner with another random partnered individual until no duplicates remain, preserving\
  \ individual degrees.\n\nNetwork Dynamics (at discrete time steps):\n1. Partnership\
  \ Dissolution:\n   - Each existing partnership of type i has a constant probability,\
  \ sigma_i, of dissolving at each time step. The average duration of a type i partnership\
  \ is 1/sigma_i.\n   - The probability of an individual in state k (defined by the\
  \ vector of partnership counts) transitioning to state k_i- (loss of one partnership\
  \ of type i, and no other changes) is given by P_k->k_i- = k_i * sigma_i * (1-sigma_i)^(k_i-1)\
  \ * PRODUCT_{j != i} ( (1-sigma_j)^k_j ), where k_x is the number of partners of\
  \ type x.\n\n2. Partnership Formation:\n   - Formation probabilities are calculated\
  \ to maintain the target degree distributions (d_m(k), d_f(k)) in a steady state,\
  \ balancing dissolution, the influx of new unpartnered individuals (entering at\
  \ rates r_m for men and r_f for women into the 0-partner state), and partnership\
  \ loss due to death (though the model simplifies this by assuming mortality doesn't\
  \ differentially affect partnership states for the calculation of formation probabilities).\n\
  \   - A Markov model of partnership dynamics at the population level is used. The\
  \ states are the allowed partnership combinations (k). The unknown transition probabilities\
  \ for gaining a partnership (P_m(k->k_i+) for men, P_f(k->k_i+) for women, representing\
  \ gaining a type i partnership when in state k) are found by solving a convex quadratic\
  \ optimization problem (P, defined by Eq. 10-17).\n   - This optimization minimizes\
  \ the mean squared error between the achieved steady-state degree distributions\
  \ (u_m(k), u_f(k)) and the target distributions (d_m(k), d_f(k)). Constraints ensure\
  \ valid probabilities and that, on average, men and women gain the same number of\
  \ new partnerships of each type.\n\nSimulation of Formation:\n   - The calculated\
  \ formation probabilities P_m(k->k_i+) and P_f(k->k_i+) are used.\n   - For each\
  \ partnership type i: First, apply P_m(k->k_i+) to male individuals to determine\
  \ the total number of new type i partnerships to be formed by men.\n   - Then, randomly\
  \ select an equal number of women to gain a new type i partnership. These women\
  \ are chosen proportionally to their individual probabilities of gaining such a\
  \ partnership (derived from P_f(k->k_i+)).\n   - Finally, the selected men and women\
  \ are randomly paired to form new partnerships, ensuring no duplicate existing partnerships\
  \ are formed."
infection_model: 'The framework is general. The manuscript details an application
  to HIV in sub-Saharan Africa. This HIV model includes:

  - Discrete disease states: Uninfected (D0), Acute HIV infection, Chronic HIV infection,
  Treatment-eligible state.

  - States have different infectivities and HIV-related mortality risks.

  - HIV treatment is included, which extends life and reduces infectivity of treated
  individuals.

  - Continuous CD4 cell counts are modeled for each individual, influencing disease
  progression, mortality risk (HIV-related and opportunistic infections), and eligibility
  for treatment (e.g., CD4 < 200 cells/uL). Progression of CD4 counts differs for
  untreated and treated individuals.

  - Transmission occurs from infected individuals to their sexual partners, with per-act
  transmission probabilities varying by disease state (e.g., higher in acute phase).'
