description: "The manuscript presents and compares two types of models for the spread\
  \ of an infection without recovery: \n1. Model M(0/c) and M(0/v): A model with instantaneous\
  \ contacts (no partnership duration), where every contact is with a new partner.\
  \ This is a standard S-I type model.\n2. Model M(+/c) and M(+/v): A model with explicit\
  \ pair formation and partnership duration. Contacts leading to transmission occur\
  \ within partnerships. \n\nThe manuscript first analyzes these models assuming constant\
  \ infectivity (denoted with /c) and then extends them to incorporate variable infectivity\
  \ with two stages (denoted with /v).\n\n**Model M(0/c) (Constant Infectivity, No\
  \ Pair Formation):**\nDescribed by the equations (Eq. 1):\ndS/dt = nu - (mu + beta*h*I/N)S\n\
  dI/dt = (beta*h*S/N - mu)I\nwhere S is the number of susceptibles, I is the number\
  \ of infecteds, N is the total population size (N = nu/mu), nu is the recruitment\
  \ rate, mu is the rate of leaving the sexually active population, beta is the contact\
  \ rate, and h is the transmission probability per contact.\n\n**Model M(+/c) (Constant\
  \ Infectivity, With Pair Formation):**\nThis model tracks uninfected singles (X0),\
  \ infected singles (X1), pairs of two susceptibles (P00), pairs with one susceptible\
  \ and one infected (P01), and pairs with two infecteds (P11).\nPair formation occurs\
  \ according to phi(Xi, Xj) = rho * (Xi*Xj)/(X0+X1) (Eq. 2).\nThe full model is a\
  \ system of ODEs (Eq. 3):\ndX0/dt = nu + (sigma + mu)(2P00 + P01) - (mu + rho)X0\n\
  dX1/dt = (sigma + mu)(2P11 + P01) - (mu + rho)X1\ndP00/dt = 1/2 * rho * X0^2/X -\
  \ (sigma + 2mu)P00\ndP01/dt = rho*(1-h)*X0*X1/X - (sigma + phi*h + 2mu)P01\ndP11/dt\
  \ = 1/2 * rho * X1^2/X + phi*h*X0*X1/X + phi*h*P01 - (sigma + 2mu)P11 \n(Note: The\
  \ equation for dP11/dt in the paper has a typo, it should be rho*X0*X1/X for new\
  \ S-I pairs, and the term with P01 should reflect infections within S-I pairs. The\
  \ provided system in Eq. 3 seems to include the infection within P01 pairs in the\
  \ last term for dP11/dt. The manuscript later simplifies this to a 3-dimensional\
  \ system (Eq. 6) assuming the pair formation process is at equilibrium: X1, P01,\
  \ and total prevalence I = X1 + P01 + 2P11.\ndX1/dt = (sigma + mu)I - (2mu + rho\
  \ + sigma)X1\ndP01/dt = rho*(1-h)*X1*(1-X1/X*) - (sigma + phi*h + 2mu)P01\ndI/dt\
  \ = phi*h*X1*(1-X1/X*) + phi*h*P01 - mu*I\n\n**Model M(0/v) (Variable Infectivity,\
  \ No Pair Formation):**\nTwo stages of infection, I1 and I2, with transmission probabilities\
  \ h1 and h2 respectively. Transition from stage 1 to stage 2 occurs at rate gamma.\n\
  Equations (Eq. 20):\ndI1/dt = beta*(h1*I1 + h2*I2)*S/N - (gamma + mu)*I1\ndI2/dt\
  \ = gamma*I1 - mu*I2\n\n**Model M(+/v) (Variable Infectivity, With Pair Formation):**\n\
  This model is an extension of M(+/c) to include two stages of infection for infected\
  \ singles (Xi), pairs of a susceptible with an infected of stage i (P0i), and total\
  \ infecteds in stage i (Ii).\nThe final formulation involves 6 equations for X1,\
  \ X2, P01, P02, I1, I2 (Eq. 22):\ndX1/dt = (sigma + mu)I1 - (2mu + rho + sigma +\
  \ gamma)X1\ndX2/dt = (sigma + mu)I2 + gamma*X1 - (2mu + rho + sigma)X2\ndP01/dt\
  \ = (1-h1)*rho*X1*(1-(X1+X2)/X*) - (2mu + sigma + h1*phi + gamma)P01\ndP02/dt =\
  \ (1-h2)*rho*X2*(1-(X1+X2)/X*) + gamma*P01 - (2mu + sigma + h2*phi)P02\ndI1/dt =\
  \ phi*(h1*P01 + h2*P02) + rho*(h1*X1 + h2*X2)*(1-(X1+X2)/X*) - (mu+gamma)I1\ndI2/dt\
  \ = gamma*I1 - mu*I2\n\nDemographic process: Constant recruitment (nu) into the\
  \ population, and time spent in the population is exponentially distributed with\
  \ a constant mean (1/mu). No additional mortality due to disease. Being infected\
  \ does not influence propensity to form partnerships or have sexual contact within\
  \ a partnership."
