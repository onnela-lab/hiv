description: "The model considers a population of men who have sex with men (MSM).\
  \ New individuals enter the population as single and susceptible. Individuals leave\
  \ the sexually active population at a rate μ. The total population size, n, is assumed\
  \ to be large and its dynamics are such that n fluctuates around an average value.\
  \ \nPair-formation for steady partnerships:\n- Single individuals form steady partnerships\
  \ at a rate proportional to the fraction of single individuals, P0. The specific\
  \ rate constant is ρ, so the rate is ρP0 per single individual.\n- Individuals can\
  \ have at most one steady partner at a time.\n- Steady partnerships dissolve at\
  \ a separation rate σ per partnership. The mean duration of a steady partnership,\
  \ considering dissolution and individual departure, is 1/(σ + 2μ).\n- The model\
  \ assumes the proportion of single individuals, P0, and partnered individuals, P1\
  \ = 1-P0, are in a stable state. P0 is expressed in terms of ρ, σ, and μ.\n- The\
  \ rate of sexual acts within a steady partnership is λ*.\nCasual contacts:\n- Both\
  \ single individuals and those in steady partnerships can engage in casual sexual\
  \ contacts.\n- The model uses two parameters to capture casual contact behavior:\
  \ ω0, the rate at which a single individual tries to have casual sex, and ω1, the\
  \ rate at which an individual in a steady partnership tries to have casual sex.\
  \ Typically ω0 > ω1.\n- The rate of casual contact between individuals depends on\
  \ their partnership status and these rates (ω0, ω1). For example, the rate for a\
  \ single individual to have casual sex with other singles is proportional to ω0*ω0*P0,\
  \ and with partnered individuals is proportional to ω0*ω1*P1 (these are terms appearing\
  \ in the ODEs for infection transmission).\n- The model does not allow for overlapping\
  \ steady partnerships, but individuals in steady partnerships can have concurrent\
  \ casual contacts.\nThe overall model is stochastic, with events (partnership formation/dissolution,\
  \ casual contacts, infection, recovery) occurring based on exponentially distributed\
  \ random variables. A deterministic approximation using a system of ordinary differential\
  \ equations is also provided to describe the expected fractions of individuals in\
  \ different states (e.g., single susceptible, partnered infectious)."
infection_model: SIR (Susceptible -> Infectious -> Removed). Individuals are infected
  with HIV and are infectious until diagnosed and successfully treated with HAART,
  at which point they are considered 'removed' and no longer transmit the infection.
  The rate of diagnosis followed by successful treatment is γ.
