description: 'The manuscript describes a deterministic compartmental heterosexual
  pair-formation model for Chlamydia trachomatis transmission. The population is stratified
  by age (15–18, 19–24, 25–39, 40–54 years), sex, partnership status, sexual risk
  behavior, and chlamydial infection status. The pair-formation framework explicitly
  represents partnerships as compartments. This allows for modeling differential infection
  risks between single and paired individuals. For instance, pairs where both partners
  are susceptible are protected from external infection (unless concurrency occurs
  with an external infected partner), and if one infected person in a pair is diagnosed
  and treated but their immediate partner is not, reinfection within the partnership
  is considered likely. The model is operationalized using difference equations (details
  in Web Appendix 2).

  Partnership dynamics include three mutually exclusive statuses:

  1. Non-sexually active (in the two youngest age groups). By age 25, all individuals
  are assumed to be sexually experienced.

  2. Unpaired (single) sexually active individuals: These individuals can form casual
  partnerships, modeled as instantaneous, at age-specific rates.

  3. Paired individuals: Long-term partnerships (e.g., cohabiting, marital) are formed
  from the unpaired pool. Pair formation is preferentially within the same age group,
  though women may form partnerships with older men.

  Heterogeneity in sexual risk behavior is modeled at two levels:

  *   Partnership level: Pairs are predominantly monogamous with a low frequency of
  concurrency. Concurrency for paired individuals is modeled similarly to casual partnerships
  for single individuals (short-term instantaneous partnership from the casual partners
  pool).

  *   Population level: 10% of the population is assumed to belong to a higher-risk
  group (with higher rates of casual and concurrent partners), while 90% belong to
  a lower-risk group with fewer such partners.

  When a pair dissolves, individuals return to the unpaired state.

  The model incorporates time-varying parameters for: sensitivity of diagnostic tests,
  age-specific screening rates, adoption of nucleic acid amplification tests, completeness
  of case reporting to the CDC, and initiation of sexual activity in the youngest
  age group. Specific values and functional forms for many parameters are detailed
  in Web Appendices, which are not provided with the main manuscript text.'
infection_model: Chlamydia trachomatis infection. Natural history is represented using
  a susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS-like) structure, differentiating asymptomatic
  and symptomatic infections, and first from subsequent infections. Transmission occurs
  via unprotected sex in heterosexual partnerships. Infection risk comes from the
  main partner in a pair and from casual/concurrent partners. Testing of symptomatic
  individuals and screening of asymptomatic individuals are included. A background
  natural recovery rate is modeled. Partner notification is explicitly modeled for
  long-term partnerships, with time-invariant parameters.
