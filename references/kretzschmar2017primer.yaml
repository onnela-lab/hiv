description: 'The manuscript introduces pair formation models for STIs, starting with
  a basic model for partnership dynamics without infection (Section 2). This model
  considers a population of singles (X) and individuals in pairs (P). Singles form
  new pairs (rate constant ρ for a single to find a partner), and pairs separate (rate
  constant σ). Individuals enter as singles (rate B) and leave the population from
  any state (rate μ).

  Equations:

  dX/dt = B – μX – ρX + 2σP + 2μP

  dP/dt = (1/2)ρX – σP – 2μP


  This is then extended to an SIS (Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible) infection model
  (Section 3). The population is divided into susceptible singles (X0), infected singles
  (X1), susceptible-susceptible pairs (P00), susceptible-infected pairs (P01), and
  infected-infected pairs (P11). Transmission occurs in P01 pairs (rate β), and infected
  individuals recover (rate γ). Pair formation occurs via random mixing of singles
  based on their proportions among all singles X_total = X0+X1.

  Equations (1) describe this system:

  dX0/dt = B – μX0 – ρX0 + σ(2P00 + P01) + μ(2P00 + P01) + γX1

  dX1/dt = –μX1 – ρX1 + σ(2P11 + P01) + μ(2P11 + P01) – γX1

  dP00/dt = (1/2)ρX0^2/X_total – σP00 – 2μP00 + γP01

  dP01/dt = ρX0X1/X_total – σP01 – 2μP01 – γP01 - βP01 + 2γP11

  dP11/dt = (1/2)ρX1^2/X_total – σP11 – 2μP11 + βP01 – 2γP11


  Finally, a model with two types of partnerships (steady, P, and casual, Q) is introduced
  (Section 5). These differ in dissolution rates (σ1, σ2) and potentially transmission
  rates (β1, β2). A fraction `f` of new partnerships are steady. This leads to a larger
  system of ODEs (Equations 2 for dX0/dt, dX1/dt and Equations 3 for dPij/dt, dQij/dt).
  For example:

  dX0/dt = B – μX0 – ρX0 + σ1(2P00 + P01) + σ2(2Q00 + Q01) + μ(2P00 + P01 + 2Q00 +
  Q01) + γX1

  (And 7 more equations for dX1/dt, dPij/dt and dQij/dt as per Eq. 2 and 3).

  The models assume continuous time and are deterministic. The manuscript is a primer
  and does not provide sufficient detail for full reproduction of all derivations
  or more complex extensions mentioned (e.g. concurrency models).'
