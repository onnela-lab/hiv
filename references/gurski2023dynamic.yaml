description: "The manuscript presents a deterministic, autonomous population model\
  \ for HIV transmission among men who have sex with men (MSM), formulated as a system\
  \ of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). The model is an SIaIcIv type, where\
  \ the population is divided into Susceptible (S), Acutely Infected (Ia), Chronically\
  \ Infected (Ic), and Virally Suppressed (Iv) compartments. The model incorporates\
  \ both casual and long-term sexual partnerships. The key innovation is how it accounts\
  \ for the impact of long-term partnerships on the infection rate without explicitly\
  \ tracking individual pairs. This is achieved by calculating the expected value\
  \ of the rate of infection from these extended contacts, using a linearization of\
  \ this expected value. \n\nThe total rate of infection (λ) is the sum of the rate\
  \ from casual partners (λ^z) and long-term partners (λ^P). The rate from casual\
  \ partners (λ^z) follows a standard mass action form: z * (βa*Ia + βc*Ic + βv*Iv)\
  \ / N, where z is the rate of casual sexual encounters and βj are transmission probabilities\
  \ per act. \n\nThe rate of infection from long-term partners (λ^P) is further divided\
  \ into two components: λ^PI, for infection from a partner chosen while already infectious,\
  \ and λ^PS, for infection from a partner who was chosen while susceptible but became\
  \ infected later (potentially through an outside partnership, modeled by concurrency\
  \ parameter ξ). \n\nFor λ^PI (Section 3.1, Eq. 3-14), the derivation involves an\
  \ integral over the history of partnerships, considering the probability of acquiring\
  \ an infected partner at a past time k, the probability of partnership survival\
  \ until current time t, and the rates of transmission (Xa, Xc, Xv) from the three\
  \ infected classes. Linear approximations are used for the historical population\
  \ sizes N(k) and numbers in each infected class Ij(k) to make the calculation tractable.\
  \ The resulting λ^PI is expressed as U^I - λ*Xa*U^S, where U^I depends on current\
  \ infected populations and their rates of change, and U^S depends on the susceptible\
  \ population and total population change rate.\n\nFor λ^PS (Section 3.2, Eq. 16-23),\
  \ the derivation considers a partner acquired while susceptible. It involves the\
  \ probability of acquiring a susceptible partner, partnership survival, the probability\
  \ the partner is still susceptible (accounting for external partnerships via ξλ),\
  \ and the probability the partner becomes infected during the partnership. This\
  \ also involves an integral and linearization, resulting in λ^PS = λ*ψ*ξ*U^S + λ*W^S,\
  \ where ψ is the transmission rate from a newly infected long-term partner and W^S\
  \ is a term related to population dynamics.\n\nThe overall infection rate λ is then\
  \ solved for implicitly from the combined equation λ = λ^z + λ^PI + λ^PS (Eq. 24-25).\
  \ The model tracks susceptible individuals infected by casual partners versus long-term\
  \ partners for each infection stage, leading to a system of 11 ODEs (Eq. 27). Transmission\
  \ rates within long-term partnerships (Xj) account for the number of long-term partners\
  \ per year (p/τ), condom use (θap, αp), and number of sexual contacts (nj) over\
  \ the partnership duration for each stage j. Concurrency is incorporated via the\
  \ parameter ξ in the λ^PS term."

population_structure: The model focuses on the MSM (men who have sex with men) population.
  Within this population, individuals are structured by infection status (Susceptible,
  Acute, Chronic, Virally Suppressed) and engage in casual or long-term partnerships.
  No other explicit structuring (e.g., by age, detailed sexual activity levels beyond
  partnership type) is described for the core model equations.
