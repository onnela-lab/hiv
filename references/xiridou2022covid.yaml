description: 'The manuscript describes a mathematical pair-formation model for men
  who have sex with men (MSM) in The Netherlands. The model simulates the formation
  and dissolution of main partnerships, as well as 1-time and short-term casual partnerships.
  Men can have only one main partner at a time, but can have multiple casual partners
  concurrently with a main partnership. The MSM population (N=200,000, with entry/exit
  rate μ=0.02/year) is stratified into two sexual activity groups: low-activity (75%
  of population) and high-activity (25%). These groups have different rates of forming
  main partnerships (r_i) and casual partnerships (α_i for 1-time, w_i for short-term),
  and these rates also differ by whether a man is single or has a main partner. Partnership
  choice (for main and casual partners) incorporates assortative mixing by activity
  level, with specific parameters εS for main (75% assortative) and εC for casual
  (60% assortative) partnerships, indicating the proportion of partnerships formed
  with individuals of the same activity group. Main partnerships are formed at rates
  r_i and have durations d_ij (e.g., d_LL for low-low partnerships is 3-5 years; d_LH
  for low-high is 0.75-1.5 years), implying dissolution rates σ_ij = 1/d_ij. One-time
  casual partnerships are acquired at rates α_i. Short-term casual partnerships are
  acquired at rates w_i and have an average duration of 2 weeks, implying a constant
  dissolution rate (26 per year). The model is dynamic and was used for simulations
  over 7 years. Parameters for pre-COVID sexual behavior were estimated from the Amsterdam
  Cohort Study (ACS). The exact equations governing partnership formation dynamics,
  particularly how assortativity (εS, εC) and population stratification influence
  pairing probabilities, are stated to be in a supplement (http://links.lww.com/OLQ/A731),
  which was not provided for this review.'
infection_model: The model describes transmission of Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) and
  Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG) among MSM. It models anogenital CT and NG infections,
  assuming them to be a single type of infection (not site-specific). Infections can
  be symptomatic (θ_CT = 30-50%, θ_NG = 35-75% symptomatic) or asymptomatic. Symptomatic
  cases have a duration of 1-2 weeks (1/γs) and are assumed to be treated and recover.
  Asymptomatic cases remain infectious (duration 1/γa_CT = 10-14 months for CT, 1/γa_NG
  = 5-7 months for NG) until natural recovery or detection via opportunistic testing
  followed by treatment. Transmission probability per condomless anal intercourse
  (CAI) act (β) is specific to CT (0.1-0.3) or NG (0.3-0.5).
