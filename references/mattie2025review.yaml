description: 'The manuscript is a comprehensive review of network models used to study
  HIV spread over the past 44 years. It does not present a single, novel pair-formation
  model with full implementation details. Instead, it categorizes and describes two
  primary paradigms of network modeling for pair formation: statistical and mechanistic.

  Statistical network models discussed include:

  - Erdos-Renyi (ER) models: Edges (pairs) are formed randomly with a specified probability
  between nodes.

  - Stochastic Block Models (SBMs): Nodes are grouped into blocks, and pair formation
  probability depends on the block membership of the two nodes.

  - Exponential Random Graph Models (ERGMs): These models define the likelihood of
  a network based on various network statistics or motifs (e.g., number of pairs,
  homophilous pairs, concurrent pairs/triangles). Pair formation is implicitly defined
  by the chosen statistics and their associated parameters.

  Mechanistic network models discussed include:

  - Barabasi-Albert (BA) models: Networks grow via preferential attachment, where
  new nodes are more likely to form pairs with existing nodes that already have many
  pairs (high degree).

  - Watts-Strogatz (WS) models: Generate networks with small-world properties, affecting
  pair formation by creating local clustering and short global path lengths for connections.

  - Configuration Models (CMs): Generate random networks with a predefined degree
  sequence (number of partners per individual). Pairs are formed by randomly connecting
  available ''stubs'' (half-edges) from individuals.

  - Agent-Based Models (ABMs): Individuals (agents) are assigned attributes and behavioral
  rules. Pair formation and dissolution are governed by these rules, often probabilistic,
  which can depend on agent characteristics (e.g., age, risk group, preferences for
  certain partner types) and the current network state. These rules typically operate
  over discrete time steps to simulate the dynamics of relationships.

  The review highlights that these models are used to simulate interactions (including
  pair formations and dissolutions) among individuals, upon which HIV transmission
  dynamics are typically overlaid. The manuscript''s purpose is to summarize existing
  work and guide future research, rather than providing a reproducible implementation
  of one specific pair-formation model.'
infection_model: The manuscript reviews network models specifically for understanding
  HIV spread. It indicates that these network models are coupled with HIV transmission
  dynamics. While not detailing a single universal infection model, the review implies
  that the transmission components within these studies account for various biological
  and behavioral factors influencing HIV transmission probability per contact. These
  factors include antiretroviral therapy (ART) status and adherence, pre-exposure
  prophylaxis (PrEP) use, condom use, co-infection with other STIs (which can affect
  HIV susceptibility or infectivity), and implicitly viral load through treatment
  effects. The specifics of the infection model (e.g., SI, SIS, SIR type dynamics,
  per-act transmission probabilities) would vary depending on the particular study
  being reviewed.

  - Risk behaviors (e.g., people who inject drugs/intravenous drug users (PWID/IDUs)).

  - Demographic characteristics (e.g., age, such as heterosexual adolescents (HetAd),
  adolescent sexual minority males (ASMM)).

  homeless youth (HY), children of HIV+ mothers (CH+M)).
