description: "The manuscript describes a dynamic pair-formation model for a same-sex\
  \ (Men who Sex with Men - MSM) population in Sweden to study the impact of PrEP.\
  \ Individuals are categorized into two sexual activity groups: high active and low\
  \ active. Individuals can have at most one steady (long-term) sex partner at a time;\
  \ steady partnerships end by separation or death. Concurrently with steady partnerships,\
  \ or when single, individuals can form casual (one-off/occasional) sex partnerships.\
  \ The rate of forming casual partnerships is higher for single individuals compared\
  \ to those in a steady partnership. The model defines 16 specific rates for forming\
  \ casual partnerships, denoted α_rq^(i,j), where 'r' and 'q' are the activity degrees\
  \ (high/low) of the two individuals involved, and 'i' and 'j' are their respective\
  \ steady partnership statuses (0 for single, 1 for partnered). \nThree mixing patterns\
  \ for casual partnerships between activity groups are considered: (1) Proportionate\
  \ mixing (partners chosen randomly based on overall sexual activity in the population).\
  \ (2) Complete assortativity (high actives only partner with high actives, low actives\
  \ only with low actives). (3) Fitted assortativity, where mixing is calibrated based\
  \ on a proxy question about partners' sexual activity from survey data; this resulted\
  \ in an estimated assortativity coefficient of 0.14, indicating moderate assortativity.\
  \ For casual encounters, mixing between single individuals and those in a steady\
  \ partnership is assumed to be random (proportionate). PrEP is offered to high-active\
  \ individuals in the model."
infection_model: 'The model incorporates an HIV infection component. It is a compartmental
  model (Susceptible -> Infectious -> Removed-like, where ''Removed'' includes individuals
  on ART). There are two stages of infectiousness: an early acute stage and a subsequent
  chronic stage. The per-act probability of HIV transmission via anal intercourse
  is higher in the acute stage (p_a) than in the chronic stage (p_c). Condom use,
  with an assumed efficacy, reduces this transmission probability. Individuals who
  initiate ART are assumed to be virally suppressed and non-infectious. Pre-Exposure
  Prophylaxis (PrEP), when taken by high-active susceptible individuals, reduces their
  susceptibility to HIV infection by 86%. Individuals on PrEP are also assumed to
  undergo HIV testing every third month.'

  reason: This is the authors' previous work, which the current model elaborates upon,
    focusing on pair formation for HIV transmission among MSM. It directly discusses
    a dynamic network model with steady and casual partners for this population prior
    to the PrEP analysis presented in the current manuscript, thus foundational for
    the pair-formation aspects of the current model.
