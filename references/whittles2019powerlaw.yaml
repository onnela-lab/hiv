description: 'The manuscript presents a dynamic sexual network model where partnerships
  form and dissolve over time based on individuals'' intrinsic propensities (λj).
  Each individual ''j'' has a propensity λj, drawn from a distribution f(λ), to form
  and break partnerships. Partnership formation between individuals j and l (if not
  already partnered) occurs as a Poisson process with rate α(λj, λl). Partnership
  dissolution also occurs as a Poisson process with rate d(λj, λl).

  The model is specifically designed so that the cumulative number of distinct partners
  an individual has over a one-year period follows a pre-specified power-law distribution
  p(κ) ∝ κ^(-γ), where γ is a key input parameter. The probability q(λj, λl) that
  individuals j and l have been in a partnership at some point over the last year
  is mathematically defined (Eq 3 on page 13). This definition uses the stationary
  probability of them being in a partnership at any given time, qo(λj, λl) = α(λj,
  λl) / (α(λj, λl) + d(λj, λl)), and the formation rate α(λj, λl).

  The functions α(λj, λl) and d(λj, λl) are derived to meet these requirements. The
  model assumes q(λj, λl) = g(λj)g(λl) (Eq 11, page 14), and that the dissolution
  rate is proportional to the formation rate, d(λj, λl) = φ * α(λj, λl) (page 14),
  where φ is a constant influencing partnership duration and concurrency. The function
  g(λ) is derived (Eq 15, page 14) to ensure the target power-law degree distribution
  (characterized by γ and a lower degree cutoff k0).

  A constraint is applied to the partnership breakup rates: the minimum breakup rate
  d_min(λj, λl) is set to 1/(50φ), ensuring that the longest partnerships (those with
  the smallest breakup rates) are exponentially distributed with a mean duration of
  50 years (page 15). This constraint, combined with the derived q(λj, λl) needed
  for the power-law degree distribution, determines the formation rate α(λj, λl) (Eq
  17, page 15).

  The actual dynamics of partnership formation and dissolution events are simulated
  using a Gillespie algorithm, which is a continuous-time stochastic simulation method
  (details in S2 Appendix, referenced on page 15). The model''s key input parameters
  that define the network structure are γ (power-law exponent), k0 (related to the
  proportion of individuals with zero partners), and φ (related to average partnership
  duration).'
infection_model: A stochastic individual-based model for gonorrhoea transmission is
  used, adapted from reference [33]. Individuals are initially uninfected (U). Upon
  contact with a contagious individual (I, S, or A) through the sexual network, they
  can become infected at a rate β. Infected individuals enter an incubation period
  (I) and leave this state at a rate σ. A proportion ψ of these individuals develop
  symptoms (S), while the remaining (1-ψ) become asymptomatic (A). Symptomatic individuals
  (S) seek treatment at a rate μ. Asymptomatic individuals (A) can be screened and
  treated at a rate η, or they may recover (naturally or due to unrelated antibiotic
  treatment) at a rate ν. Individuals who receive treatment enter a treated state
  (T) and subsequently recover to the uninfected state (U) at a rate ρ. The contagious
  states are I, S, and A. This is illustrated in Fig 3B (page 6) and described on
  page 15.

population_structure: The model simulates a population of N Men who have Sex with
  Men (MSM). Heterogeneity among individuals is incorporated through an intrinsic
  propensity, λj, for each individual 'j' to form and break partnerships. This λj
  is drawn from a probability distribution f(λ), which is itself mathematically derived
  to ensure that the network exhibits the desired power-law distribution of partners
  over a one-year period. The manuscript mentions simulations for N=10,000 MSM, representing
  those aged between 15 and 65 in a UK city (page 4), although age is not an explicit
  dynamic variable in the model beyond defining the baseline population.
