description: "The manuscript describes a stochastic, continuous-time Markov process\
  \ model for pair formation and dissolution, coupled with an SI (Susceptible-Infective)\
  \ epidemic model. The population is structured into L distinct groups of males (m_1,\
  \ ..., m_L) and N distinct groups of females (f_1, ..., f_N). Individuals are characterized\
  \ by their group and infection status (0 for susceptible, 1 for infective).\n\n\
  The state of the system at time t, denoted by ξ_t, is a vector where each component\
  \ ξ_t(s) represents the number of entities of type 's'. An entity 's' can be a single\
  \ individual or a pair. Types of singles include (m_i, μ) or (f_j, μ) representing\
  \ a single male from group m_i or female from group f_j with infection status μ.\
  \ Types of pairs include heterosexual (m_i, μ; f_j, ν), homosexual male (m_i, μ;\
  \ m_k, ν), and homosexual female (f_j, μ; f_k, ν), where μ and ν are the infection\
  \ statuses of the partners.\n\nThe model dynamics are defined by the following transition\
  \ rates (from the 'Epidemic Model with Pairing', pages 8-9):\n\n1.  **Pair Formation\
  \ from Singles (g,μ) and (h,ν)**:\n    Let g and h represent distinct individual\
  \ types (e.g., g is (group_1, status_μ) and h is (group_2, status_ν)). Singles of\
  \ type (g,μ) and (h,ν) form pairs. β_{g,h} is the rate constant for pair formation\
  \ attempts between individuals from general groups g and h.\n    *   **Discordant\
  \ Pairing (μ ≠ ν) with Transmission**: Susceptible becomes infective. Rate = β_{g,h}\
  \ * α_{g,h} * ξ((g,μ)) * ξ((h,ν)). This results in a pair where both partners are\
  \ effectively infective (or the initially susceptible one becomes infective, status\
  \ μ∨ν for both in the new pair contextually means the susceptible partner adopts\
  \ the infective status).\n    *   **Discordant Pairing (μ ≠ ν) without Transmission**:\
  \ Susceptible remains susceptible. Rate = β_{g,h} * (1 - α_{g,h}) * ξ((g,μ)) * ξ((h,ν)).\
  \ This results in a pair (g,μ; h,ν).\n    *   **Concordant Pairing (μ = ν)**: Both\
  \ susceptible or both infective. Rate = β_{g,h} * ξ((g,μ)) * ξ((h,ν)). This results\
  \ in a pair (g,μ; h,ν).\n\n2.  **Pair Dissolution**: A pair of type (g,μ; h,ν) dissolves\
  \ into two single individuals (g,μ) and (h,ν).\n    Rate = σ_{g,h} * ξ((g,μ;h,ν)),\
  \ where σ_{g,h} is the per-pair dissolution rate.\n\n3.  **Death of Infective Individuals**:\n\
  \    *   **Single Infective Male**: A single male of type (m_i,1) dies. Rate = δ_{m_i}\
  \ * ξ((m_i,1)).\n    *   **Single Infective Female**: A single female of type (f_j,1)\
  \ dies. Rate = δ_{f_j} * ξ((f_j,1)).\n    *   **Infective Male in a Pair**: An infective\
  \ male (m_i,1) in a pair (m_i,1; h,ν) dies. The pair dissolves, and the partner\
  \ (h,ν) becomes single. Rate = δ_{m_i} * ξ((m_i,1; h,ν)).\n    *   **Infective Female\
  \ in a Pair**: An infective female (f_j,1) in a pair (g,μ; f_j,1) dies. The pair\
  \ dissolves, and the partner (g,μ) becomes single. Rate = δ_{f_j} * ξ((g,μ; f_j,1)).\n\
  \nThe manuscript uses c(ξ,η) to denote the rate of transition from state ξ to state\
  \ η. The model aims to generalize classical epidemic models by explicitly incorporating\
  \ pair dynamics. The primary focus of the paper is the limit behavior of this pair\
  \ formation model when dissolution rates are large."
infection_model: SI model. Individuals are either susceptible (status 0) or infective
  (status 1). Infection transmission primarily occurs at the point of pair formation
  between a susceptible and an infective individual, with probability α_{g,h}. Infective
  individuals may die from the disease at rates δ_{m_i} or δ_{f_j}.
