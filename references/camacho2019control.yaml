description: "The manuscript presents a compartmental pair-formation model to study\
  \ the dynamics of Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs) under different public\
  \ health strategies. The model is an extension of Kretzschmar and Dietz (1998) and\
  \ operates within a susceptible-infectious-susceptible (SIS) framework. \n\nState\
  \ Variables:\n- X0(t): Number of single susceptible individuals.\n- X1(t): Number\
  \ of single infected individuals.\n- P00(t): Number of pairs with two susceptible\
  \ individuals.\n- P01(t): Number of pairs with one susceptible and one infected\
  \ individual.\n- P11(t): Number of pairs with two infected individuals.\nThe total\
  \ number of single individuals is X(t) = X0(t) + X1(t). The total number of pairs\
  \ is P(t) = P00(t) + P01(t) + P11(t).\n\nModel Assumptions (Section 2, page 4103):\n\
  (i) Susceptible individuals are recruited as singles at a rate ν and leave the sexually\
  \ active population at a rate μ.\n(ii) Single individuals form pairs at a rate ρ.\
  \ Pairs dissolve at a rate σ or due to death (μ).\n(iii) Transmission occurs within\
  \ P01 pairs. φ is the contact rate within partnerships, and h is the transmission\
  \ probability per contact. A control function uC(t) (condom promotion) can reduce\
  \ h.\n(iv) Infected individuals recover naturally at a rate γ, returning to the\
  \ susceptible class. Recovery is increased by a treatment control function uT(t).\n\
  \nThe model is described by the following system of ordinary differential equations\
  \ (Equation 1, pages 4103-4104):\n\nX0' = ν + (σ + μ)(2P00 + P01) - (μ + ρ)X0 +\
  \ (γ + uT)X1\n\nX1' = (σ + μ)(2P11 + P01) - (μ + ρ)X1 - (γ + uT)X1\n\nP00' = (1/2)ρ(X0^2/X)\
  \ - (σ + 2μ)P00 + (γ + uT)P01\n\nP01' = ρ(X0*X1/X) - ρ(1 - h(1-uC))(X0*X1/X) - (σ\
  \ + φh(1-uC) + 2μ)P01 - (γ + uT)P01 + 2(γ + uT)P11\n\nP11' = (1/2)ρ(X1^2/X) + ρh(1-uC)(X0*X1/X)\
  \ + φh(1-uC)P01 - (σ + 2μ)P11 - 2(γ + uT)P11\n\n(Note: The formulation for the formation\
  \ of P01 pairs, specifically the terms ρ(X0*X1/X) - ρ(1 - h(1-uC))(X0*X1/X), simplifies\
  \ to ρ(X0*X1/X)h(1-uC). This appears to differ from the visual representation in\
  \ Figure 1, where P01 formation from X0 and X1 is proportional to (1-h_eff). The\
  \ description here adheres to the written equations in the manuscript.)\n\nThe model\
  \ is used to explore constant, feedback, and optimal control strategies for STIs\
  \ like trichomoniasis, gonorrhea, chlamydia, and HPV. A reduced version of the model\
  \ (Equation 6) is derived under the assumption of equilibrium pair formation dynamics\
  \ for further analysis like R0 calculation and optimal control problem setup."
infection_model: SIS (Susceptible-Infectious-Susceptible) framework. The model describes
  curable STIs (trichomoniasis, gonorrhea, chlamydia) where individuals return to
  susceptible state after recovery, and also analyzes HPV (non-curable) under transmission
  control.
