description: "The general pair formation model (Model 2) describes the transmission\
  \ dynamics of STIs by accounting for both single individuals and pairs. The population\
  \ is divided into singles based on disease state: X0 (susceptible), X1 (acutely\
  \ infected), and X2 (chronically infected). Pairs are monogamous and denoted Pjk,\
  \ where j and k (0,1,2) represent the disease status of each partner. Six types\
  \ of pairs are considered: P00 (S-S), P10 (S-I1), P20 (S-I2), P11 (I1-I1), P12 (I1-I2),\
  \ and P22 (I2-I2). \nIndividuals are recruited into the susceptible singles population\
  \ (X0) at a rate π. Single individuals (Xi) form pairs at a per-capita rate ρ. The\
  \ specific type of pair formed depends on the infection status of the two individuals\
  \ forming the pair, e.g., an X0 and an X1 individual form a P10 pair. The rate of\
  \ formation for a specific pair type X_i-X_j is ρ*Xi*Xj / (X0+X1+X2) (or half this\
  \ for identical types like X0-X0). Pairs dissolve at a rate σ, returning individuals\
  \ to their respective single state populations. All individuals are subject to a\
  \ natural death rate μ. \nDisease transmission occurs only within discordant pairs.\
  \ A susceptible individual in a pair with an acutely infected partner (P10) can\
  \ become infected at a rate λ1, transitioning the pair to P11 (I1-I1, as new infection\
  \ is acute). A susceptible in a pair with a chronically infected partner (P20) can\
  \ become infected at a rate λ2, transitioning the pair to P12 (I1-I2, as new infection\
  \ is acute). \nInfected individuals (both singles and those in pairs) can transition\
  \ from the acute infection stage (I1) to the chronic stage (I2) at a rate γ. Transition\
  \ from chronic (I2) back to acute (I1) can occur at a rate η (e.g., for HSV-2).\
  \ \nThe model is described by a system of nine ordinary differential equations (Eq.\
  \ (6) on page 10 and Figure 2 on page 9), tracking the population sizes of X0, X1,\
  \ X2, P00, P10, P20, P11, P12, and P22. The model does not explicitly account for\
  \ gender."
infection_model: 'Two-stage SI model: Individuals can be Susceptible (S), Acutely
  Infected (I1), or Chronically Infected (I2). New infections enter the I1 stage.
  I1 individuals are typically more infectious. Individuals transition from I1 to
  I2 at rate γ. For some diseases (like HSV-2), transition from I2 back to I1 can
  occur at rate η. Individuals are recruited into S and experience natural death from
  all states.'
