description: 'The manuscript describes a deterministic, compartmental mathematical
  model of heterosexual HIV transmission that incorporates partnership formation and
  dissolution. Sexual contact is assumed to occur at a constant frequency within steady
  partnerships, as casual one-off contacts by paired individuals outside their steady
  partnerships, and as casual one-off contacts by unpaired (single) individuals. The
  model structure aims to capture occurrences relevant to time-varying HIV infectivity,
  such as infection within a pair, or infection from outside contacts upon partnership
  dissolution or if partners are not monogamous. While long-term concurrency is not
  explicitly modeled, the framework allows for consecutive partnerships and sporadic
  concurrency (one-off contacts outside a steady pair). Individuals enter the model
  as sexually active single people and exit after an assumed sexual lifespan of 35
  years, with additional AIDS-related mortality.

  The population is stratified into two distinct sexual behavior risk groups (lower-risk
  and higher-risk), and individuals remain in their assigned risk group throughout.
  Steady partnerships are formed only between individuals within the same risk group.
  However, one-off casual contacts can occur with partners from any risk group (chosen
  without risk-group restrictions). The model allows for increased HIV transmission
  probabilities for contacts involving higher-risk partners, reflecting an assumed
  greater likelihood of transmission-amplifying cofactors (e.g., STIs, anal intercourse)
  in this group. Sexual behaviour parameters (rates of pair formation, dissolution,
  contact frequencies) are assumed to be constant across HIV infection status and
  infection stage categories. The model equations were solved numerically using a
  Runge-Kutta 4 algorithm.'
infection_model: The model includes a detailed HIV infection progression, divided
  into early infection, asymptomatic HIV, early AIDS, and late AIDS. Early HIV infection
  (defined as the initial 1 to 6 months of raised infectivity) is further divided
  into five intervals (first four are 1 week each, the fifth is variable) to capture
  changes in transmission probabilities related to changing viral loads. The asymptomatic
  period is represented by three equal intervals of 1.8 to 3.2 years each. Durations
  for early AIDS (mean 0.75 years) and late AIDS (mean 0.83 years) are based on data
  from Rakai, Uganda. Per-contact transmission probability during late AIDS is set
  to zero.
