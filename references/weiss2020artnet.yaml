description: 'The manuscript presents descriptive results and summary statistics from
  the ARTnet study, explicitly stating these are intended to parameterize stochastic
  network models for HIV/STI transmission, particularly Temporal Exponential Random
  Graph Models (TERGMs). The study characterizes network features critical for pair-formation
  models: degree distributions, assortative mixing by attributes (race/ethnicity,
  age, HIV status), and partnership durations (estimated from current partnership
  age assuming geometrically distributed durations). These are stratified by partnership
  type (main, casual, one-time), demography, and geography. The manuscript also explicitly
  discusses (page 8) how these data can be used to derive parameters (e.g., partnership
  acquisition and dissolution rates) for pair-formation ordinary differential equation
  (ODE) models. For instance, partnership acquisition rate is defined as mean degree
  divided by mean partnership duration, and an example calculation is provided for
  main partnerships. Dissolution rates are the reciprocal of mean partnership durations.
  While providing the empirical basis and methods for deriving parameters, the paper
  does not present a novel, fully specified pair-formation model (e.g., the specific
  set of TERGM terms or full ODE system) itself, but rather the foundational data
  and statistics for such models.'
infection_model: The manuscript states ARTnet data is for HIV/STI prevention research
  and to parameterize network models for disease projection. EpiModel, a tool mentioned
  for building such models, can incorporate infection dynamics. However, this paper
  focuses on the network characterization and does not specify the details of any
  particular STI/HIV infection process or model (e.g., states like Susceptible, Infected,
  Recovered; or specific transmission probabilities) that would be coupled with the
  described network dynamics.
network_type: unimodal
parameters:
- description: The per-week rate at which main partnerships dissolve. This is derived
    as the reciprocal of the mean age of ongoing main partnerships (272.5 weeks),
    assuming geometrically distributed partnership durations as stated on page 3 and
    8. A common symbol for this type of parameter is σ_main.
  estimate: 0.00367
  location: Derived from mean partnership age reported in Abstract, Page 5 (text),
    and Table 4 (272.5 weeks).
  symbol: Not explicitly given in manuscript
- description: The per-week rate at which casual partnerships dissolve. This is derived
    as the reciprocal of the mean age of ongoing casual partnerships (133.0 weeks),
    assuming geometrically distributed partnership durations as stated on page 3 and
    8. A common symbol for this type of parameter is σ_casual.
  estimate: 0.00752
  location: Derived from mean partnership age reported in Abstract, Page 5 (text),
    and Table 4 (133.0 weeks).
  symbol: Not explicitly given in manuscript
- description: The overall weekly partnership acquisition rate for main partnerships,
    suitable for use in ODE pair-formation models. Calculated as mean main partnership
    degree (0.45 from Table 2) divided by mean main partnership duration (272.5 weeks
    from Table 4). A common symbol for this type of parameter is ρ_main.
  estimate: 0.00165
  location: Explicitly calculated on Page 8.
  symbol: Not explicitly given in manuscript
- description: The overall weekly partnership acquisition rate for casual partnerships,
    suitable for use in ODE pair-formation models. Calculated as mean casual partnership
    degree (0.74 from Table 2) divided by mean casual partnership duration (133.0
    weeks from Table 4). A common symbol for this type of parameter is ρ_casual.
  estimate: 0.00556
  location: Derived using formula on Page 8, with mean degree from Page 4/Table 2
    and mean duration from Page 5/Table 4.
  symbol: Not explicitly given in manuscript
- description: The mean weekly rate of acquiring new one-time partners per participant.
    This directly serves as a formation rate parameter for one-time partnerships.
    A common symbol for this type of parameter is ρ_onetime.
  estimate: 0.163
  location: Abstract, Page 4, Table 2 (as 'One-Time Mean').
  symbol: Not explicitly given in manuscript
population_structure: Structured by age (e.g., 15-24, 25-34, etc.), race/ethnicity
  (Black non-Hispanic, White non-Hispanic, Hispanic, Other/Multiple), self-reported
  HIV status (Negative, Positive, Unknown), U.S. Census region/division, urbanicity
  (e.g., Large Central Metro, Large Fringe Metro, etc.), and by sexual partnership
  type (main, casual, one-time).
