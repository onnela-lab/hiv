description: 'The manuscript describes a stochastic, discrete-time microsimulation
  model of pair formation and dissolution in a heterosexual population of fixed size
  (N=2000). The model aims to study the effect of concurrent partnerships on HIV spread.


  Key features of the pair-formation model:

  1.  **Population**: Fixed size (N=2000), structured by sex (men and women having
  different concurrency patterns and degree distributions).

  2.  **Partnership Types**: Two types are modeled: spousal (long-term) and non-spousal
  (short-term, e.g., consensual lovers).

  3.  **Partnership Dissolution**: Existing partnerships dissolve at constant rates:
  `σ1` for spousal and `σ2` for non-spousal. This implies exponential partnership
  durations, with mean durations estimated from the 1994 Ugandan sexual network survey
  data (239.1 months for spousal, 28.4 months for non-spousal).

  4.  **Partnership Formation**: New partnerships form based on a process governed
  by an overall rate parameter `ρ` and a parameter `φ` (the fraction of new partnerships
  that are spousal). The deterministic average rates of formation are given by `ρφ(M
  - P - Q)` for spousal and `ρ(1-φ)(M - P - Q)` for non-spousal, where `P` and `Q`
  are the current numbers of spousal and non-spousal pairs, respectively. `M` is the
  maximum number of possible partnerships in the network, defined as `3 * (Nm + Nf)/2`,
  reflecting a data-informed maximum of 3 partners per person. The parameters `ρ`
  and `φ` are derived from empirical estimates of equilibrium `P` (670) and `Q` (122),
  dissolution rates (`σ1`, `σ2`), and `M`, using equilibrium equations.

  5.  **Concurrency**: The model explicitly incorporates concurrent partnerships.
  The probability of forming a new partnership is conditioned on the current number
  of partners (degree) of both individuals involved. Individuals can form new partnerships
  even if already partnered, up to the maximum of 3 partners.

  6.  **Mixing**: Mixing by degree is proportional. Men and women have different marginal
  rates of concurrency. The mixing matrix `r_ij` (where `r_ij = i*m_i*N_m * j*f_j*N_f
  / D^2`) is used to represent proportional mixing by degree and is an input to the
  simulation. This means individuals with many partners are as likely to pair with
  monogamous individuals as with multi-partnered individuals, given their marginal
  degree distributions.

  7.  **Simulation Dynamics**: The simulation starts by running the partnership formation
  and dissolution process until it reaches a dynamic equilibrium. After this, the
  disease transmission process is initiated.

  8.  **Data Source**: Model parameters and structures are based on the 1994 Ugandan
  Sexual Network Study in Rakai District.'
infection_model: HIV transmission is modeled as a stochastic process. Disease transmission
  occurs within active partnerships between susceptible and infected individuals at
  a constant rate of 0.05 per day. This rate is stated to be consistent with per-act
  female-to-male transmission probability estimates from Thailand (Mastro et al.,
  1994). There are no vital dynamics (births, deaths unrelated to HIV) or disease-related
  mortality considered in the 5-year simulation runs, so the population size remains
  constant.
