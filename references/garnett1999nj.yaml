description: 'The manuscript describes a deterministic, continuous-time compartmental
  model for gonorrhoea transmission, adapted from Hethcote & Yorke (1984). The model
  is defined by a system of Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) provided in Appendix
  A.


  Population Structure: The population is stratified by sex (k, where k=1 for men,
  k=2 for women) and into four sexual activity classes (i=1 to 4) for each sex. These
  activity classes are characterized by their mean rate of sex-partner change (Ck,i).
  The proportion of individuals of sex k in activity group i is denoted φk,i, and
  the total number of individuals in this subgroup is Nk,i.


  Pair Formation: Pair formation is driven by the sex- and group-specific rates of
  partner change, Ck,i. The choice of partners across different activity groups is
  governed by a mixing matrix, Pk,ij, which specifies the probability that an individual
  of sex k in activity group i forms a partnership with an individual of the opposite
  sex k'' in activity group j.

  The mixing pattern is controlled by a single parameter ε (epsilon), where ε=0 represents
  random mixing and ε=1 represents fully assortative mixing (partnerships only with
  individuals of the same activity level). The formula for Pk,ij is:

  Pk,ij = ε * δi,j + (1 - ε) * (Nk'',j * Ck'',j / Σ_s Nk'',s * Ck'',s)

  where δi,j is the Kronecker delta (1 if i=j, 0 otherwise). The term Nk'',j * Ck'',j
  represents the total number of partnerships offered by group (k'',j), and the sum
  in the denominator is over all activity groups ''s'' of the opposite sex k''.


  Partnership Balance: The model ensures a balance in the total number of partnerships
  formed by men and women. This is achieved by assuming the total partnerships supplied
  by corresponding activity groups are equal (N1,i * C1,i = N2,i * C2,i). This allows
  the rate of partner change for women (C2,i) to be derived from the rates for men
  (C1,i) and the relative sizes of these groups (N1,i and N2,i, which depend on φ1,i
  and φ2,i).


  Force of Infection: The rate at which susceptible individuals in group (k,i), denoted
  Xk,i, acquire infection (force of infection, Λk,i) is given by:

  Λk,i = βk * Ck,i * Σ_j [Pk,ij * (Yk'',j + Ak'',j) / Nk'',j]

  where βk is the transmission probability per partnership for an individual of sex
  k, and (Yk'',j + Ak'',j) / Nk'',j is the prevalence of infectious individuals (symptomatic
  Yk'',j and asymptomatic Ak'',j) in the partner group (k'',j). The term Nk'',j in
  the denominator represents the total population size of partner group (k'',j).'
infection_model: 'The model describes gonorrhoea transmission with three epidemiological
  states for individuals in each sex and activity group: Susceptible (X), Symptomatically
  Infected (Y), and Asymptomatically Infected (A).

  Upon infection, susceptible individuals (X) transition to either state Y or A. According
  to the equations and their description in Appendix A (page 795), a proportion θk
  (specific to sex k) of new infections become symptomatic (Y), and the remaining
  proportion (1-θk) become asymptomatic (A). It is important to note an inconsistency:
  Appendix B (page 796, parameter table) and discussions in the main text (e.g., page
  790, Figure 9 caption) define θk as the ''proportion asymptomatic''. The model equations
  in Appendix A, however, use θk as the proportion becoming symptomatic.

  Individuals in state Y recover at a rate σk, and those in state A recover at a rate
  γk. Upon recovery, individuals return to the susceptible state X (i.e., no acquired
  immunity is modelled).

  New individuals enter the susceptible pool of each group (k,i) at a rate μ*Nk,i
  (where Nk,i is the total size of that subgroup), and individuals leave all epidemiological
  states at a per capita rate μ, maintaining a constant population size in each subgroup.'
