description: 'The manuscript describes an agent-based model called TANGO (Transient
  Attachment Network alGOrithm) to simulate sexual pair formation in the European
  MSM population. The model is executed in discrete time-steps (Δt).


  In the model:

  1.  Each agent ''i'' has individual-specific rates for seeking new partners (αi)
  and for seeking encounters with previous partners (βi).

  2.  The rates αi are drawn from an ''a-distribution'', described as a power-law
  with exponent γ, and upper/lower bounds b_u and b_l. The manuscript also lists a
  parameter β₀ as the ''mean rate of seeking new encounters''.

  3.  The rates βi are drawn from a ''β-distribution'' with a shape parameter k_β.

  4.  In each time-step Δt, an agent ''i'' seeks a first-time encounter with probability
  αi*Δt and a network encounter (with a known partner) with probability βi*Δt.

  5.  When a first-time encounter occurs between agents i and j, an edge is formed
  with an initial weight (o_ij = 1).

  6.  Subsequent network encounters between i and j increment the weight o_ij by 1.

  7.  The rate of encounters between connected individuals i and j is proportional
  to the connection weight o_ij.

  8.  Connection weights o_ij decay over time. The manuscript provides two descriptions
  for this decay: Page 7 states ''connections decay at rate o_ij Δt/M'', while the
  Fig 2A caption states ''Connections decay at the rate 1/M''. M is a ''memory'' parameter.

  9.  For network encounters, edges are chosen with a probability proportional to
  their weight o_ij.

  10. Steady partnerships are not explicitly built-in but are defined heuristically:
  a partnership between i and j is considered steady if o_ij > 1, and for both partners,
  the weight o_ij is greater than the sum of weights of their other connections (o_ij
  > Σ_{k≠j} o_ik and o_ij > Σ_{k≠i} o_jk).


  The model parameters (related to network structure) are first fitted to reproduce
  observations from the Danish Project SEXUS survey data (e.g., 1-year degree distribution,
  encounter rates, partnership dynamics). Subsequently, the mpox transmission dynamics
  are incorporated, and a secondary attack rate (p) and the upper bound for new partner
  acquisition rate (b_u) are fitted to reproduce epidemic characteristics (e.g., activity
  of cases, reproduction number).'
infection_model: 'The mpox infection model is of SEIR type (Susceptible, Exposed,
  Infectious, Recovered).

  - The mean latent period (T_E) is set to 5 days.

  - The effective infectious period (T_I) is dynamic and changes over time, reflecting
  responsive behavioral changes (e.g., self-isolation upon symptom awareness). T_I(t)
  is calculated from the time-varying mean serial interval T_S(t) using the formula
  T_I(t) = 2 * (T_S(t) - T_E). The serial interval T_S(t) is modeled by a sigmoid
  function, decreasing from an initial T_S,max of 14 days to T_S,min of 6.5 days.
  This results in T_I decreasing from approximately 18 days to 3 days.

  - State transitions (e.g., from E to I, I to R) are modeled as a two-step Poisson
  process, meaning the duration in each state follows an Erlang distribution with
  a shape factor of 2.

  - A secondary attack rate (p) is a biological parameter adjusted during the fitting
  process for epidemic trajectories.'

population_structure: The model simulates a highly heterogeneous European MSM (men
  who have sex with men) population. Heterogeneity is primarily driven by individual-specific
  rates of seeking new partners (αi) and existing partners (βi), which are drawn from
  distributions. This results in a highly skewed (power-law like) degree distribution,
  consistent with observed sexual behavior and the concept of a 'core group' with
  high-risk sexual lifestyles that disproportionately drives transmission. The model
  uses an effective population size (N_eff) of 100,000, stated to correspond to twice
  the Danish population of MSM. Observational data for fitting network parameters
  come from the Danish Project SEXUS survey.

  reason: Cited as a seminal article for addressing concurrent partnerships, a key
    aspect of pair formation and network structure relevant to STI transmission, including
    mpox in this manuscript. The TANGO model accounts for overlapping relationships
    implicitly through its mechanism of forming and maintaining connections over time
    based on encounter history, which relates to concurrency concepts.
