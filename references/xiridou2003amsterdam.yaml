description: 'The manuscript describes a deterministic compartmental model using a
  system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to simulate HIV transmission among
  young homosexual men in Amsterdam. The model is based on Kretzschmar and Dietz (1998)
  [6] and tracks individuals based on their partnership status (single, or in a steady
  pair) and HIV infection status (uninfected, primary infection stage 1, secondary
  infection stage 2).


  Pair formation aspects:

  1.  **Steady Partnerships**: Individuals form steady, non-concurrent partnerships
  at a rate ''p'' (rho) and these partnerships dissolve at a rate ''σ'' (sigma). Equations
  track pairs of different HIV statuses (P00, P01, P02, P11, P12, P22, where 0=uninfected,
  1=stage 1, 2=stage 2).

  2.  **Casual Partnerships**: Individuals can also form casual partnerships, assumed
  to involve only one sexual contact per partner. Singles acquire casual partners
  at rate ''ps'', and men in steady partnerships acquire them at a lower rate ''pm''.

  3.  **Negotiated Safety (NS)**: HIV-negative concordant steady partners may make
  NS agreements, which reduces their risky behaviour with casual partners (parameter
  ''θ'').


  The model was extended from Kretzschmar and Dietz (1998) to include:

  *   Earlier removal from the sexually active population for men developing AIDS.

  *   Explicit modeling of casual partnerships alongside steady ones.

  *   Effects of HIV diagnosis: a proportion ''δ'' of those in stage 2 know their
  status, leading to a reduction ''fa'' in risky behaviour and uptake of HAART for
  a proportion ''τ'' of those diagnosed.

  *   Effects of HAART: reduces infectivity by ''fr'' and prolongs the time to AIDS.

  *   Transmission risk dependent on UAI type (URAI/UIAI), HIV stage of the infected
  partner, and HAART status.


  The full system of differential equations is provided in the Appendix of the manuscript.'
infection_model: 'The model incorporates a two-stage HIV infection process:

  1.  **Primary Infection (Stage 1)**: Short duration (1/γ), characterized by high
  infectivity.

  2.  **Secondary Infection (Stage 2)**: Longer, asymptomatic period with lower infectivity.
  Individuals may be diagnosed (''δ'') during this stage.


  HIV transmission occurs via unprotected anal intercourse (UAI), with separate probabilities
  for receptive (URAI) and insertive (UIAI) acts. These probabilities (P1a, P2a, P1b,
  P2b) vary depending on whether the infectious partner is in stage 1 or stage 2 of
  infection. Transmission probability from other sexual acts is considered negligible.


  HAART''s effects on the infection model include:

  *   Reduction in infectiousness/transmission probability (parameter ''fr'').

  *   Prolongation of the time from infection to the development of AIDS for treated
  individuals (1/(μ+μτ)) compared to untreated (1/(μ+μα)).


  A proportion of diagnosed individuals (''τ'') are successfully treated. A reduction
  in risky behaviour (''fa'') is also associated with HIV diagnosis.'

population_structure: 'The model population consists of young (≤ 30 years at recruitment)
  homosexual men in Amsterdam. The population is structured by:

  1.  **HIV infection status**: Uninfected (X0), infected stage 1 (primary infection,
  X1), infected stage 2 (asymptomatic secondary infection, X2).

  2.  **Partnership status**: Singles (X0, X1, X2) and individuals in steady partnerships
  (P00, P01, P02, P11, P12, P22, where subscripts denote the HIV status of the partners).

  3.  **Diagnosis status**: A proportion (''δ'') of those in stage 2 are aware of
  their HIV infection.

  4.  **Treatment status**: A proportion (''τ'') of diagnosed individuals receive
  HAART.

  Individuals are recruited into the sexually active population and are removed when
  they cease sexual activity or (earlier) if they develop AIDS.'
