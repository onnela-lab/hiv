description: "The manuscript describes a Complex Agent Network (CAN) model, a hybrid\
  \ approach combining Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) and Complex Networks (CNs), to simulate\
  \ HIV transmission among Men Who Have Sex with Men (MSM) in Amsterdam. \n\n1.  **Network\
  \ Structure & Initialization**:\n    *   The population consists of N0 agents (MSM),\
  \ with ages initialized randomly between 15 and 65 years.\n    *   Each agent is\
  \ assigned a desired number of sexual partners per year (degree, k) from a scale-free\
  \ power-law distribution pk = Ck^-gamma (for k >= 1) or pk = p0 (for k=0), with\
  \ a maximum degree kmax.\n    *   Initial partnerships (edges) are formed using\
  \ the configuration model: agents' 'stubs' (half-edges, summing to their degree\
  \ k) are randomly matched.\n    *   Newly formed partnerships are designated as\
  \ 'steady' with probability Psteady, or 'casual' otherwise. Steady partnerships\
  \ are assigned an initial duration drawn from a discrete uniform distribution DU(1,\
  \ 2) years.\n\n2.  **Dynamic Processes (per 1-year time step)**:\n    *   **Demographics**:\
  \ Agents age. Agents are removed if age > 65, upon reaching AIDS stage (removed\
  \ at the next time step), or by migrating (with probability Pmigration per year).\
  \ Removed agents are replaced by new susceptible agents (age 15-65, assigned a degree\
  \ k, form partnerships via configuration model), maintaining a constant population\
  \ size.\n    *   **Partnership Dynamics (Pair Formation and Dissolution)**:\n  \
  \      *   Durations of existing partnerships are incremented.\n        *   **Dissolution**:\
  \ Steady partnerships dissolve if their duration exceeds their initialized expected\
  \ duration. Casual partnerships from the previous time step are conserved with probability\
  \ Pcasual_conserve; others dissolve. Partnerships also dissolve if a partner is\
  \ removed.\n        *   **Formation**: New agents form partnerships as per initialization.\
  \ Existing agents with dissolved partnerships (and thus available stubs or unfulfilled\
  \ target degrees) reform partnerships. The manuscript states edges are reshuffled\
  \ according to the configuration model (Section 3.2), implying stubs are re-matched\
  \ to maintain the degree distribution. Newly formed partnerships are typed (steady/casual)\
  \ and assigned durations as in initialization.\n    *   **Partnership Types**:\n\
  \        *   **Steady**: Agents can have at most one steady partner. Characterized\
  \ by longer duration and higher frequency of sexual acts (NAij_steady, drawn from\
  \ P(30) per year).\n        *   **Casual**: Agents can have multiple casual partners.\
  \ Characterized by shorter duration (typically 1 year if not renewed) and lower\
  \ frequency of sexual acts (NAij_casual = 1 per year).\n\n3.  **Behavioral Modifiers\
  \ for Transmission**: \n    *   If an agent Vj (susceptible) has a steady partner,\
  \ their risk behavior in any concurrent casual partnership (e.g., with Vi) is modified\
  \ by a partnership factor F Pj (typically reducing risk).\n    *   A general risk\
  \ behavior factor FRij applies to a pair ViVj, varying by calendar year and HIV\
  \ status of the infectious partner Vi."
infection_model: "The model simulates HIV infection with the following stages: Susceptible,\
  \ Primary Infection (PI), Asymptomatic Period (AP), and AIDS. \nTransmission is\
  \ per unprotected anal intercourse (UAI) act; other routes are considered negligible.\
  \ The per-act transmission probability from an infected agent Vi to a susceptible\
  \ agent Vj (PTAij) depends on:\n1.  Vi's disease stage: TPPI,1 (for the first 3\
  \ months of PI), TPPI,2 (for months 3-12 of PI), TPAP (for AP stage). TPAIDS = 0.\
  \ Values are specified for unprotected receptive (URAI) and insertive (UIAI) acts,\
  \ with roles chosen randomly per act.\n2.  Vi's treatment status: A treatment reduction\
  \ factor FTi (e.g., due to HAART) modifies transmissibility.\n3.  Pair-specific\
  \ risk behavior: An empirically derived factor FRij, varying by calendar year and\
  \ Vi's HIV status.\n4.  Partnership context for Vj: If Vj has a steady partner,\
  \ a factor FPj modifies transmission risk in Vj's casual partnerships.\n\nThe number\
  \ of sexual acts per year (NAij) between Vi and Vj depends on partnership type:\n\
  *   Steady partnerships: NAij_steady drawn from P(30) acts/year. During PI, acts\
  \ are NAij,1_steady_PI from P(8) (first 3 months) and NAij,2_steady_PI from P(22)\
  \ (next 9 months).\n*   Casual partnerships: NAij_casual = 1 act/year.\n\nThe overall\
  \ probability per year that Vj becomes infected by Vi (PTYij) is calculated from\
  \ PTAij and NAij, accounting for the two sub-stages of PI if Vi is in PI. The total\
  \ probability per year for Vj to be infected by any partner (PTYj) is 1 - product_over_infected_partners_m(1\
  \ - PTYmj).\n\nDisease progression: Susceptible -> PI -> AP -> AIDS. PI duration\
  \ is implicitly 1 year (0.25y + 0.75y). AP duration is variable (Poisson distributed,\
  \ mean depends on treatment success: 13 years for failed, 22 years for successful).\
  \ AIDS is an absorbing state leading to removal from the population in the next\
  \ time step. The model includes probabilities for diagnosis, treatment uptake, and\
  \ treatment success."
