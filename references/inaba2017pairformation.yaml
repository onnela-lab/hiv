description: "The manuscript describes continuous-time pair formation models used\
  \ in demography, which are also relevant to epidemiology. Two main classes of models\
  \ are presented:\n\n1.  **Non-age-structured models (e.g., Kendall's model, Section\
  \ 4.2):** These are systems of Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) that track\
  \ the populations of single females `x(t)`, single males `y(t)`, and pairs `p(t)`.\
  \ The core dynamics (Eq 4.4) are:\n    *   `dx/dt = (k_x + mu_y + sigma)p - mu_x*x\
  \ - psi(x,y)`\n    *   `dy/dt = (k_y + mu_x + sigma)p - mu_y*y - psi(x,y)`\n   \
  \ *   `dp/dt = -(mu_x + mu_y + sigma)p + psi(x,y)`\n    (Note: The manuscript's\
  \ equations for `dx/dt` and `dy/dt` on page 5, Eq 4.4, represent new individuals\
  \ entering single populations due to widowhood/divorce from the term `(k_birth_of_sex\
  \ + mu_death_of_partner_sex + sigma)p` and individuals leaving single population\
  \ due to their own death `mu_own_sex*own_sex_singles` and pair formation `psi(x,y)`.\
  \ Births `k_x*p` and `k_y*p` are into the categories of children, who then mature\
  \ into singles, which is simplified in this formulation where `k_x` and `k_y` in\
  \ `dp/dt` for example, are birth rates *of new singles of the respective sex from\
  \ couples dissolving or producing new adults directly*. More typically, `k_x` and\
  \ `k_y` are birth rates of new individuals, and `p` would reduce due to death of\
  \ its members. The formulation `(k_x + mu_y + sigma)p` for `dx/dt` implies that\
  \ `k_x*p` are new female singles born from existing pairs (or it's a typo and should\
  \ refer to females returning to single state). Page 5 states `k_x` and `k_y` are\
  \ birth rates of females/males *per couple*. The equations imply these newborns\
  \ immediately become singles or that `k_x` and `k_y` are rates at which existing\
  \ couples contribute to the single population pool directly, perhaps after maturation\
  \ which is not explicitly modeled here. The term `(mu_y + sigma)p` (for `dx/dt`)\
  \ accounts for females becoming single due to partner death or divorce. Symmetrically\
  \ for `dy/dt`. The term `psi(x,y)` is the marriage function, representing the rate\
  \ of new pair formation from the pools of `x` single females and `y` single males.\
  \ Various functional forms for `psi(x,y)` are discussed (e.g., harmonic mean, geometric\
  \ mean, minimum function), often assumed to be homogeneous of degree one, signifying\
  \ that the per-capita chance of marriage depends on the relative frequency of the\
  \ other sex.\n\n2.  **Age-structured models (e.g., Fredrickson's model, Section\
  \ 4.3):** These are systems of Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) incorporating\
  \ age. Populations are densities like `x(t,a)` (female singles of age `a`), `y(t,a)`\
  \ (male singles of age `a`), and `p(t,a,b)` (pairs with female age `a`, male age\
  \ `b`). The dynamics (Eq 4.27) include:\n    *   `dx(t,a)/dt + dx(t,a)/da = -mu_x(a)x(t,a)\
  \ - integral(rho(t,a,z)dz) + integral(p(t,a,z)[sigma(a,z) + mu_y(z)]dz)` (and similar\
  \ for `y(t,a)`).\n    *   `dp(t,a,b)/dt + dp(t,a,b)/da + dp(t,a,b)/db = rho(t,a,b)\
  \ - (sigma(a,b) + mu_x(a) + mu_y(b))p(t,a,b)`.\n    *   Boundary conditions for\
  \ `x(t,0)` and `y(t,0)` involve fertility `beta(a,b)` from pairs. `p(t,0,b)=p(t,a,0)=0`.\n\
  \    Here, `rho(t,a,b)` is the density of newly formed (a,b) couples, given by a\
  \ marriage function `Psi(x(t,.), y(t,.))(a,b)`. These models consider age-specific\
  \ rates for death, divorce (`sigma(a,b)`), and fertility (`beta(a,b)`). Extensions\
  \ further incorporate pair duration (e.g., Staroverov-Hadeler model `p(t,a,b,c)`\
  \ and Inaba's model `p(t,c; a,b)` for couples formed at ages `a,b` with duration\
  \ `c`). Marriage functions `Psi` for age-structured models can take forms like proportionate\
  \ mixing or generalized means.\n\nThe manuscript focuses on the demographic aspects\
  \ and mathematical analysis (existence and stability of solutions, Malthusian growth)\
  \ of these models in continuous time. While their relevance to STD transmission\
  \ is noted, the presented models do not explicitly include infection dynamics."

  and partnership status.
