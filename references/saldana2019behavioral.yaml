description: 'The manuscript presents a compartmental SIS (Susceptible-Infectious-Susceptible)
  model for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) that explicitly incorporates pair
  formation and dissolution. The primary analysis focuses on a reduced three-dimensional
  system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) (System 2 in the manuscript) tracking
  the proportions of: single infected individuals (x₁), pairs with one susceptible
  and one infected individual (p₀₁), and the total prevalence of infection (ī = I/N,
  where N is total population size). This reduction assumes that the partnership dynamics
  are at equilibrium, with X_bar representing the equilibrium proportion of single
  individuals in the total population N, given by X_bar = (σ + 2μ) / (σ + 2μ + ρ).

  Key processes modeled in System (2) are:

  1.  Pair Formation: New pairs are formed from single individuals. The rate of formation
  of new S-I pairs (p₀₁) without immediate transmission during formation is proportional
  to ρ(1-h)x₁(X_bar - x₁), where ρ is the pair formation rate, h is the transmission
  probability if a discordant pair forms, x₁ is the proportion of single infected
  individuals, and (X_bar - x₁) represents the proportion of single susceptible individuals.

  2.  Pair Dissolution: Partnerships dissolve at a rate σ.

  3.  Infection Transmission: Occurs either upon formation of a new discordant pair
  (contributing to dī/dt via ρhx₁(X_bar - x₁)) or within existing S-I pairs (p₀₁)
  at a rate φhp₀₁, where φ is the contact rate within partnerships.

  4.  Recovery: Infected individuals recover at a rate determined by a general, density-dependent
  recovery function Φ(ī). Specific forms explored are a sigmoid function Φ(I) = M
  / (1 + exp[-k(I - I₀)]) and a saturated function Φ(I) = γ / (1 + aI), where γ =
  Φ(0) is the baseline recovery rate.

  5.  Population Demographics: Individuals leave the sexually active population at
  a rate μ (e.g., mortality, aging out). The total population size N is constant.

  The system of ODEs for the reduced model (System 2) is:

  dx₁/dt = (σ + μ)ī – (2μ + ρ + σ)x₁ – Φ(ī)x₁

  dp₀₁/dt = ρ(1 – h)x₁(X_bar - x₁) - (σ + φh + 2μ)p₀₁ + Φ(ī)(ī – x₁ – 2p₀₁)

  dī/dt = ρhx₁(X_bar - x₁) + φhp₀₁ – μī – Φ(ī)ī'

    Manuscript refers to it for the concept that transmission only occurs when a susceptible
    and an infected individual form a partnership, and that S-S pairs are temporarily
    immune if they do not dissolve the pair or seek other partners (page 1).
