description: "The manuscript describes a discrete-time stochastic Markov model simulating\
  \ STD spread in a heterosexual population of 10,000 individuals (sex ratio 1:1,\
  \ max 5 partners per individual). Time steps are 1 day. Individuals are characterized\
  \ by age (15-64 years, 5 age groups, replacement at 65), gender, sexual activity\
  \ level (c=0 for low, c=1 for high/core), disease status, time since infection,\
  \ number of current partners (d), and a list of current partners (N).\n\nSexual\
  \ Activity (Core Group):\nIndividuals aged 15-34 (or new entrants at age 15) are\
  \ assigned to the core group (c=1) with probability 0.05. Otherwise, they are non-core\
  \ (c=0). Individuals become non-core (c=0) when they age to 35. \n\nPair Formation:\n\
  1.  Potential new partnerships: Each day, n_p = (Population Size / 2) - P(t) potential\
  \ partnership 'slots' are available, where P(t) is the current number of partnerships.\n\
  2.  Partnership initiation: For each of the n_p slots, an attempt to form a new\
  \ partnership occurs with probability p_form = 0.006.\n3.  Partnership type: If\
  \ a partnership is initiated, it is designated as 'steady' with probability f=0.2,\
  \ otherwise it's 'casual'.\n4.  Partner selection and confirmation: A male (y) and\
  \ a female (x) are drawn randomly from the population. They form the partnership\
  \ with a mixing probability phi(x,y). This selection process (drawing x and y) is\
  \ repeated until a pair is successfully formed for the initiated partnership. The\
  \ mixing probability phi(x,y) = phi_age(j,k) * phi_cd(cx,cy,dx,dy) depends on:\n\
  \    a.  Partnership type i (1 for steady, 2 for casual).\n    b.  Age classes (j\
  \ for female, k for male): phi_age(j,k) = 1 if j=k (same age class), and phi_age(j,k)\
  \ = (0.2)^(1+|j-k|) if j!=k. (The paper notes that the model's resulting age mixing\
  \ in Table 3 is asymmetric, while this formula is symmetric, suggesting other model\
  \ dynamics or a simplification in the textual formula.)\n    c.  Activity levels\
  \ (cx, cy) and number of current partners (dx, dy):\n        i.  For steady partnerships\
  \ (phi^1_cd): Equals 1 if both individuals are currently single (dx=0 and dy=0);\
  \ 0 otherwise.\n        ii. For casual partnerships (phi^2_cd): Equals 1 if both\
  \ are core (cx=1, cy=1). Equals 0.1 if one is core and the other is non-core and\
  \ single (e.g., cx=1, cy=0, dy=0). Equals 0.01 if both are non-core and single (cx=0,\
  \ cy=0, dx=0, dy=0). Equals 0 otherwise.\n\nPair Separation:\n- Steady partnerships\
  \ separate with a daily probability sigma1 = 0.0004.\n- Casual partnerships separate\
  \ with a daily probability sigma2 = 0.1.\n\nDemographics:\n- Individuals are replaced\
  \ upon reaching age 65 with a new 15-year-old individual, whose activity status\
  \ c' is assigned according to the rules for new entrants.\n\nThe model was run for\
  \ a pre-simulation period to reach a stationary state for partnership dynamics before\
  \ introducing infection."
infection_model: 'The model simulates two STDs: gonorrhea and chlamydia. Individuals
  can be in one of three states: susceptible (s=0), symptomatically infected (s=1),
  or asymptomatically infected (s=2). Upon infection from s=0, an individual becomes
  s=1 with a disease- and gender-specific probability p, or s=2 with probability 1-p
  (details in Table 4 of the manuscript).

  Transmission occurs within established partnerships between a susceptible individual
  and an infectious partner (s=1 or s=2, provided time since infection T is greater
  than the incubation period). Daily transmission probabilities are disease- and gender-specific
  (Table 4) and are calculated based on per-contact transmission probabilities and
  fixed daily contact frequencies (0.25/day for steady, 1/day for casual partnerships).

  Infection parameters (Table 4) include: percentage of asymptomatic infections, incubation
  times (men/women), patient delay + treatment times (men/women), and recovery rates
  from asymptomatic/symptomatic states (men/women).

  Treatment: Symptomatically infected individuals (s=1) who have passed the incubation
  time and patient delay period are treated and become susceptible (s=0) with 100%
  effectiveness. Contact tracing is implemented: upon treatment of a symptomatic individual,
  all their current partners listed in N are also immediately set to susceptible (s=0).
  There is no snowball tracing (partners of partners are not traced).

  Screening: At specified times, a percentage of a chosen subgroup can be screened,
  and if found infected, their disease status is set to susceptible (s=0).'
