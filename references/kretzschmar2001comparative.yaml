description: "The manuscript describes a stochastic, individual-based simulation model\
  \ of Chlamydia trachomatis transmission within a heterosexual population. The pair-formation\
  \ aspects of this model, with full details stated to be in Kretzschmar et al. (1996,\
  \ Ref 24), are summarized in this manuscript as follows:\nThe population is structured\
  \ by gender, age (15-64 years), and two sexual activity levels (low and high).\n\
  Individuals can form 'steady' and 'casual' partnerships, which differ in their mean\
  \ durations (exponentially distributed) and frequency of sexual intercourse. \n\
  - Low-activity individuals: Can have at most one partnership at a time. They have\
  \ a low probability of forming casual partnerships.\n- High-activity individuals\
  \ (forming a 'core group'): Can have at most one steady partner and concurrently\
  \ form casual partnerships. They have a higher probability of forming casual partnerships.\n\
  Partnership dissolution is governed by the mean durations. Age mixing in partnerships\
  \ is determined by an age-mixing matrix (details in Ref 24). The parameters for\
  \ sexual behavior and partnerships, including aspects of formation and separation\
  \ processes, are based on a 1989 Dutch survey (Ref 25).\nThis manuscript does not\
  \ provide the explicit rules or rates for partner selection and new partnership\
  \ formation beyond stating mean durations for existing partnerships, the existence\
  \ of an age-mixing matrix, and different tendencies for casual partnership formation\
  \ by activity group. Full details required to reproduce the pair-formation implementation\
  \ are stated to be in the cited Ref 24."
infection_model: 'Stochastic individual-based model of Chlamydia trachomatis. Infection
  progresses from susceptible to latent, then to infectious (either asymptomatic or
  symptomatic, with sex-specific probabilities and durations). Transmission occurs
  per sexual contact with a defined probability (tc=0.11, derived from per-partnership
  probability). Infected individuals recover naturally (with different rates for symptomatic/asymptomatic,
  men/women as per Table 2) or can be treated if symptomatic or detected via screening.
  Key parameters include incubation times (men: 12 days, women: 10 days), fraction
  asymptomatic (men: 50%, women: 70%), and patient delay before treatment for symptomatic
  cases (men: 11 days total until effective treatment, women: 14 days).'

population_structure: Structured by gender, age (15-64 years, with a uniform distribution
  over this range), and two sexual activity classes (low and high). The high-activity
  class forms a 'core group' (estimated at 2% of the total population, concentrated
  in ages 15-34 years). Mixing between age classes for partnerships is defined by
  an age-mixing matrix (details in Ref 24). Low activity individuals have at most
  one partner at a time; high activity individuals can have one steady partner and
  concurrent casual partners.
