description: 'The manuscript presents a deterministic pair-formation model for HPV
  transmission using ordinary differential equations (ODEs). The model tracks populations
  of single females (x_i) and single males (y_j) in susceptible (S), infected (I),
  or recovered (R) states, as well as monogamous pairs (P_ij) between females of state
  i and males of state j (i,j ∈ {S,I,R}).


  Pair Formation:

  Single individuals form new partnerships. The rate of formation of a new pair between
  a female of type i and a male of type j (Φ_ij) is given by Equation (13): Φ_ij =
  ρ * (x_i * y_j) / (x_S + x_I + x_R + y_S + y_I + y_R). Here, ρ is the pair formation
  rate parameter, and the denominator represents the total number of single individuals
  currently in the population. This formulation implies that partnership formation
  depends on the product of the densities of available single individuals of specific
  types, with ρ scaling the overall rate.


  Partnership Dissolution:

  Existing partnerships (P_ij) dissolve due to two main processes:

  1.  Relationship break-up: Pairs dissolve at a constant per-pair rate σ.

  2.  Departure from the sexually active population: Individuals leave the peak sexual
  activity age group (e.g., die or age out) at a per-capita rate μ. When either partner
  in a P_ij pair departs, the pair is dissolved. This is represented by a term -2μ*P_ij
  in the differential equations for each pair type P_ij (see Equations 5-12).


  Individuals are recruited into the single (unpartnered) state at a rate κ. The model
  equations (1-12) describe the dynamics of all single and paired states over time.'
infection_model: SIRS model. Susceptible (S) individuals can become Infected (I) with
  HPV through sexual contact within a partnership. Transmission from an infected to
  a susceptible partner within a pair occurs at a rate h*β, where 'h' is the number
  of sexual acts per year and 'β' is the transmission probability per sexual act.
  Infected individuals (I) recover to a temporary immune state (R) at a rate γ. This
  acquired immunity wanes over time, and recovered individuals (R) return to the susceptible
  state (S) at a rate δ. Susceptible females can also be vaccinated at a rate ω, moving
  them directly to the recovered (immune) state.

  reason: Section 1.4 states this reference developed a simple SIS model with pair
    dynamics, directly relevant to pair formation models research line discussed in
    the manuscript. The current manuscript builds upon such models by using an SIRS
    model with explicit pair dynamics (formation and dissolution).

  reason: 'Section 1.4 explicitly states that ''Kretzschmar and Dietz discuss several
    variations on a pair model [39]''. This reference is central to the concept of

    models ([35] in Section 1.4). The manuscript's model is an ODE-based pair model,
