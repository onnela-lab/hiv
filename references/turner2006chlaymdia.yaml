description: "The model is a stochastic, individual-based, dynamic sexual network\
  \ model for chlamydia transmission in Britain, extending Ghani et al. [15]. It is\
  \ exclusively heterosexual.\n\nPartnership Formation:\n- Individuals are available\
  \ to form new partnerships if their current number of partnerships is less than\
  \ their desired number. The desired number is 1 for 95% of those <35 years old and\
  \ for all those 35+ years old; it is 2 for 5% of those <35 years old.\n- Potential\
  \ pairs are selected randomly from the pool of available individuals.\n- Partnerships\
  \ form stochastically according to age-mixing preference matrices derived from Natsal\
  \ 2000 data (men tend to partner with women somewhat younger, with an age difference\
  \ mode of 0 years and a mean of 2 years).\n- A gap between partnerships is enforced,\
  \ during which an individual cannot form any new partnerships. The mean gap is 14\
  \ days, with the duration drawn from a negative binomial distribution (dispersion\
  \ parameter of 2). There's an additional period preventing an individual from re-forming\
  \ a partnership with their most recent partner immediately after dissolution.\n\n\
  Concurrency:\n- 5% of the population under 35 years old prefer 2 concurrent partners;\
  \ the remaining 95% prefer 1.\n- Individuals aged 35 and older prefer only one sex\
  \ partner. Existing concurrent partnerships are not ended when an individual turns\
  \ 35, but no new ones are formed.\n- If either partner has an existing partner when\
  \ a new partnership forms, the new concurrent partnership is always assigned as\
  \ 'short'.\n\nPartnership Duration and Type:\n- Partnerships are categorized as\
  \ 'short' or 'long', each with different mean durations.\n- The mean duration of\
  \ short partnerships is 14 days.\n- The mean duration of long partnerships for 16-year-olds\
  \ is 900 days. This preferred duration for long partnerships increases by 200 days\
  \ for each year of an individual's age.\n- The duration of any given partnership\
  \ is assumed to be exponentially distributed, implying a constant per time-step\
  \ probability of dissolution equal to 1/(average duration).\n- When a new partnership\
  \ forms, one person from the pair is selected at random, and that person's preferred\
  \ duration type (long or short) is assigned to the new partnership.\n- Individuals'\
  \ preference for short versus long partnerships is dynamic and age-dependent:\n\
  \  - The initial proportion of 16-year-olds desiring short partnerships is 60% for\
  \ men and 50% for women.\n  - Annually, a proportion of individuals who prefer short\
  \ partnerships switch to preferring long partnerships (4% for men, 8% for women).\n\
  \nAgeing and Population Dynamics:\n- Individuals age deterministically. When an\
  \ individual reaches age 45, they are removed from the population, and a new 16-year-old\
  \ individual of the same gender enters. Existing partnerships involving an individual\
  \ who ages past 44 are flagged as 'external' to the core population, so individuals\
  \ <45 in such partnerships do not become prematurely available for new partners.\n\
  - As individuals age, they generally form fewer new partnerships. This is implemented\
  \ by a fraction of the population preferring short partnerships switching to long,\
  \ and all those who prefer long partnerships increasing the average duration of\
  \ their preferred partnerships."
infection_model: A Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) model. Susceptible individuals
  are infected stochastically based on a per-sex-act transmission probability. The
  model assumes one sex act per day in partnerships that have lasted less than one
  month and 0.25 sex acts per day in longer partnerships. Infected individuals then
  either seek care or remain untreated, returning to a susceptible state following
  spontaneous recovery or treatment. The average duration of infection is fixed at
  one month for those seeking treatment and six months for those not seeking treatment.
  A fraction of newly infected individuals are assumed to actively seek treatment
  and recover at a faster rate than those not seeking treatment. After treatment for
  any reason, individuals enter a variable refractory period during which re-infection
  cannot occur (to simulate adherence to advice to abstain).

population_structure: Structured by age (16-44 years, uniform distribution at influx)
  and gender (equal numbers). Age-dependent processes for sexual behaviour (e.g.,
  partnership formation, duration preferences, switching preference from short to
  long) are implemented. Individuals are removed at age 45 and new 16-year-olds enter.
