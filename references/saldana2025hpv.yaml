description: "The manuscript presents a deterministic, compartmental pair-formation\
  \ model for HPV transmission in a heterosexual population. The population is divided\
  \ into single males (M), single females (F), and monogamous pairs (P). Singles and\
  \ individuals in pairs are further stratified by infection status (Susceptible (S),\
  \ Infectious (I)). The model was later extended to include vaccinated (V) individuals\
  \ and vaccination as a control measure (Model (6), p. 4).\n\nCore Model Dynamics\
  \ (based on Eq. 1, p. 2, and Eq. 2, p. 3):\n1.  **Population Classes**: \n    *\
  \   Single Susceptible Females (Fs), Single Infectious Females (Fı)\n    *   Single\
  \ Susceptible Males (Ms), Single Infectious Males (Mı)\n    *   Pairs: Pss (Susceptible\
  \ Female, Susceptible Male), Psı (Susceptible Female, Infectious Male), Pıs (Infectious\
  \ Female, Susceptible Male), Pıı (Infectious Female, Infectious Male).\n2.  **Recruitment\
  \ and Departure**: Individuals are recruited into the single sexually active population\
  \ at a rate 'b' (50:50 sex ratio) and leave at a per capita rate 'd'. It's assumed\
  \ b=d, and the total population N = F_total_singles + M_total_singles + 2*P_total\
  \ is normalized to 1 (p. 3).\n3.  **Pair Formation**: Governed by the law φij =\
  \ 2ρ * (Xi * Yj) / (X_total_singles + Y_total_singles), where X and Y are single\
  \ female and male populations of specific infection statuses (i,j), and ρ is the\
  \ pair formation rate constant. Infection status does not affect partnership formation\
  \ (p. 3).\n4.  **Pair Dissolution**: Pairs separate at a rate σ. When a partner\
  \ leaves the population (rate d), the other partner becomes single.\n5.  **Transmission**:\
  \ HPV transmission occurs only within discordant pairs (Psı, Pıs). The per-act transmission\
  \ probability is hm→f (male to female) and hf→m (female to male). The contact frequency\
  \ within partnerships is φ acts per unit time. For example, in a Psı pair, the susceptible\
  \ female becomes infected at a rate φ*hm→f. \n6.  **Recovery**: Infected females\
  \ recover at rate γf and males at rate γm, returning to the susceptible state (SIS\
  \ model structure). No immunity is gained from natural infection (p. 2).\n7.  **Equilibrium\
  \ Assumption**: The pair formation process (numbers of singles and pairs) is assumed\
  \ to be at equilibrium (p. 3).\n\nThe full system of ODEs for the base model is\
  \ given in Equation (1) on page 2. This model is extended (Equation 6, p.4) to include\
  \ vaccinated females (Fv), males (Mv) and corresponding pair types (Psv, Pıv, Pvs,\
  \ Pvı, Pvv), vaccination rates (uf(t), um(t)), and waning vaccine immunity at rate\
  \ θ."
