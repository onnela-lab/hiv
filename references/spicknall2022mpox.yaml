description: 'The manuscript describes a dynamic network model for Men who have Sex
  with Men (MSM), adapted from previous models for HIV and gonorrhea (Refs 3,4) and
  implemented using the EpiModel R package (Ref 8). The model simulates sexual behavior
  among a population of 10,000 MSM.

  Individuals (men) can have three types of partnerships:

  1. Main partnerships: An individual can have zero or one main partnership at a time.
  These are assumed to last 477 days on average.

  2. Casual partnerships: An individual can have zero, one, or two casual partnerships
  at a time. These are assumed to last 166 days on average.

  3. One-time partnerships: These represent single sexual encounters that are not
  repeated and are assumed to last 1 day.

  Men can have main, casual, and one-time partnerships concurrently.

  The population is structured into six sexual activity strata, which are informed
  by data from MSM in Atlanta, Georgia (2016–2019, Refs 3,4,6). These strata primarily
  differ in their rate of one-time partnership formation. For instance, men in the
  lowest activity stratum (stratum 1) have a 0.000 probability of forming a one-time
  partnership on any given day, while men in the highest activity stratum (stratum
  6) have a 0.286 probability (details for intermediate strata are not fully specified
  but are between these endpoints).

  The manuscript does not provide explicit formation rate parameters for main and
  casual partnerships across all strata, nor does it fully detail the partner choice
  mechanisms or how concurrency limits are managed beyond the stated maximums for
  each partnership type. These details would be needed for full model reproduction.'
infection_model: 'Monkeypox virus (MPXV) infection model. The model incorporates MPXV
  natural history and MSM care-seeking behaviors based on previous publications and
  metrics observed during the 2022 outbreak (Ref 7, Supplementary Box 2). Transmission
  is modeled based on a per-act transmission probability. This probability was adjusted
  to create two scenarios: a lower transmission scenario where MPXV would eventually
  infect approximately 15% of the MSM population, and a higher transmission scenario
  resulting in 25% infection. Simulations started with an introduction of 10 highly
  active MPXV cases into the susceptible population. The model tracks individual risk
  and acquisition of MPXV.'
