  Egocentric sexual networks of men who have sex with men in the United States: Results
  from the ARTnet study
description: >
  Two-wave cross-sectional online survey of homosexual cis-gender men between 15 and 65
  years of age in the United States. The study contains further breakdowns of
  relationships and mixing by age, ethnicity, and HIV status. These summaries are not
  captured here. They consider three types of relationships: "main" relationships
  representing a boyfriend or significant other, "casual" relationships with repeated
  sexual contact, and "one-time" sexual contacts. Main and casual relationships are
  collectively referred as "persistent" relationships.
